## 1 Anonymous Data Re-Identification

[Anonymous Data Re-Identification](https://wiki2.org/en/Data_re-identification) (aka De-Anonymization) is the practice of matching [anonymous data](https://wiki2.org/en/Data_anonymization) (also known as [de-identified data](https://wiki2.org/en/De-identification)) with publicly available information, or auxiliary data, in order to discover the individual to which the data belong to.

## 2 Person Re-Identification

Person Re-Identification is a popular topic in Computer Vision. Person re-identification (ReID), a fundamental task in distributed multi-camera surveillance, aims to match people appearing in different non-overlapping camera views (copied from [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00953)).

***A practice example of Person Re-Identification can be found [6_3_person_re-identification_example](https://github.com/taihui/RA_Summer2019/tree/master/6_re_identification/6_3_person_re-identification_example).***

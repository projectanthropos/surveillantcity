open cooperation: promoting smart city 
development with partners 

combining leading technologies with best practices, huawei is committed to promoting the 

development of open smart city platforms and vendor ecosystems, globally and locally."
"huawei is doing its part to contribute, through its development of what it calls “safe city solutions”—a marketing term                   

for smart city platforms that integrate and analyze the torrent of data generated by this proliferation of automated                  

surveillance technology."
"the demonstrated efficacy of technological solutions             

like huawei’s may help explain the embrace of its “safe city” platform by officials in hefei and chengdu, two large                    

cities reportedly affected by the recent truckers’ strike (​china-asean expo​, september 2017; ​ccpse​, may 30               
2016)."
"for whom the strike was broke 

 

in the case of the truckers’ strike, huawei’s safe city solutions could help to protect more than just the careers of a                      

few local officials."
"huawei has several smart city business lines; it describes its “safe city” public safety solutions as one of its                    

most important (​eastday​, october 31 2017)."
"whether huawei’s safe city technologies are being employed by authoritarian and kleptocratic regimes to reinforce               

their rule is an understudied question."
"however, it is both interesting and suggestive that the list of countries where                   

huawei’s safe city solutions were first deployed includes a number of authoritarian and hybrid regimes with close ties                  

to china, among them russia, pakistan, venezuela, laos, and angola (​huawei​, 2014)."
"it recently signed a contract to install safe city                  

solutions in the small city of valenciennes in northern france, as well as the german city of ​gelsenkirchen ​(​xinhua​,

"so too should the ways in which the prc could use huawei’s ‘safe city’ technology at home, as well as the ways in                       

which such technology could be deployed abroad."
"because i forwarded a post about a worker strike on may 1 yesterday, the

migrant outflows, and their subsequent economic success around the world."

businesses, because they might only ever deal with what they know of as chambers of commerce."
"given the high population of uyghur citizens in other sco member states, garnering law                  

enforcement cooperation from central asian countries (many of whom might have been sympathetic to the uyghur’s                

plight) was viewed as an important step in safeguarding china’s domestic security by chinese communist party                

(ccp) officials."
"smart cities harness 
the power of technology and drive 
local innovation to create jobs, provide 
a safe and high quality of life for 
residents, and attract talent, tourists, 
and visitors."
"with current and projected 
urban populations, these solutions 
can touch the majority of people in the 
world making them safe and supporting 
most of the global economic growth."
"in traffic and urban mobility, public safety 
and modern education)."
"business and residents that operate 
in the global digital economy want to 
know what continued future investment 
cities will be making for progress in 
these areas while tourists look for a city 
that is safe and easy to navigate."
"deliver public security - provide 
a safe city for people to live in and 
for tourists to visit, using sensors, 
video cameras, police body 
cameras to support community 
policing and intelligent (even 
mobile) command centers that 
discourage and prevent crime, 
and respond more quickly to 
emergencies."
"the internet of things is important in the 
smart city context because it provides 
access to new and better information in 
real time."
"rapid automation: some information 
may already be collected by people, 
but because of resource constraints, 
it cannot be collected as often or as 
detailed as needed."
"device enablement  p lat forms

cities have many areas of potential 
use cases, like remote monitoring 
or surveillance in public safety, or 
in transportation, environmental 
monitoring, or energy monitoring."
"high performance computing

smart & connected healthcare: 
the connected healthcare it 
infrastructure is made possible 
because of intelligent devices 
(including smartphones and wireless 
medical devices) and pervasive 
broadband networks that provide 
always on connectivity, along with 
big data, analytics, and cloud 
computing."
"smart education: smart education 
uses integrated hardware, software, 
services and sensors to improve 
all aspects of providing quality 
education — from managing 
facilities, student care, and safety 
to interactive classrooms and digital 
curricula."
"it bears noting that command and 

control centers are completely different 
entities than an ioc, with the latter 
functioning as data exchange layer for 
many different elements of a smart city, 
including the safe city."
"however, in times of crisis, iocs are 
force multipliers for command and 
control situations – critical tools that 
allow public safety organizations to 
integrate a plethora of information 
sources, allowing tri-service 
organizations to leverage advanced 
analytics, gis visualization software, 
sensor-driven data generated by the 
iot and mobile-driven applications."
"the safe city 

the assurance of public safety is an 
historical founding driver of civil society, 
and, in the view of numerous notable 
political theorists, the essential reason 
individuals and societies agreed to 
create the institution of government."
"safety is also arguably the primal 

or base motivation for humanity; 
psychologist abraham maslow calls 
out access to basic necessities like 
clean water, shelter, food, and safety as 
fundamental human needs which must 
be in place before individuals can pursue 
loftier goals like self-actualization."
"today, 
moving beyond history and theory into 
very tangible practical realities, the safe 
city is often an under-acknowledged 
prerequisite to realizing smart cities."
"safe cities deliver both social value 
– in terms of better overall quality of 
life – and economic value – in terms 
of industrial development, improved 
employment rates and revenue 
generation from sources such as 
increased tourism."
"according to 
a us study from 2015, the top 25 
safest cities in the us have average 
unemployment rates of 5.2%, compared 
to a national average of 6.3%; in 
contrast, average unemployment in the 
us's top ten most dangerous cities is 
28.5% (http://247wallst.com/special-
report/2015/09/30/the-most-dangerous-
cities-in-america-5/4/)."
"similar correlations can be made 
between safety and the revenue 
generated by tourism."
"a 2004 study by 
glensor and peak stated, for example, 
that “the most important prerequisite 
for a successful tourism industry is 
a reputation for keeping crime under 
control and guaranteeing tourists’ 
safety.” (http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/
mime/open.pdf?item=1306) indeed 
the stakes are high here as the global 
tourism industry generates $7.6 trillion 
dollars a year."
"safe cities uses ict to predict, prevent, 
and reduce crime; address new and 
emerging threats; improve emergency/
disaster planning and response; reduce 
the cost of operations; and allocate 
resources more effectively."
"safe 
cities work to create safe and livable 
communities using a variety of tools 
such as advanced analytics, social 
media, collaboration and information 
sharing tools, and mobile technologies 
to support emergency response 
services (fire, police, paramedic, search 
and rescue, coast guard, etc."
"), local 
law enforcement and policing, and 
the justice and corrections system 
including local courts, locally operated 
jails and prisons, probation, community 
corrections, and parole

in short, smart cities with strong 
safe city underpinnings are reliant on 
a suite of technology that includes 
video surveillance, emergent video 
communication, integrated incident 
command and control, big data, mobile, 
and secured public safety cloud."
"further to that, 100 huawei’s safe city solutions span 30 coun-
tries and serve more than 400 million people."
"huawei: next generation smart city solutions huawei has spent considerable time 
and effort building out specialized smart 
city modules on a unified platform for 
multiple, integrated, interoperable uses 
that allow cities to address specific 
pain points related to a plethora of use 
cases such as traffic, energy, and public 
safety."

kenya is an excellent example of the 
types of smart and safe city solutions, 
leveraging both the commend center 
and the iot, being implemented by 
huawei."
"these events led 
the kenyan president, uhuru kenyatta, 
to declare the implementation of the 
commend center as one of the country’s 
highest priorities to improve public 
safety..

huawei, in partnership with safaricom 
(kenya’s largest mobile network 
operator) began working with the 
kenyan government and police force to 
implement a next-generation commend 
center to manage this unrest."
"the partnership with safaricom sought 
to accelerate the implementation of a 
national mobile broadband network 
upon which the national safety network 
could be implemented."
"to date, the 
commend center consists of the 
following solutions:

"longgang is an excellent example of 
a smart, safe city leveraging the ioc 
and iot to deliver value to residents

huawei and partner solutions

in conjunction with its partner 
ecosystem of leading vendors in the 
smart cities market, huawei and 
the city of longgang implemented a 
comprehensive, end-to-end platform 
solution leveraging cloud, virtualization, 
big data analytics, gis and data 
visualization, and iot."
"solution platform must keep 
citizens at the center of city 
operations

urban safety must be enhanced 
through next-generation 
technologies

advanced analytical tools need 
to deliver real social value and 
increased livability

leverage the iot, big data 
analytics, cloud computing, 
mobile, social and cognitive to 
collectively catalyze existing 
industrial productivity

take key insights from the 
longgang pilot projects and

safe, smart cities that are interested in developing an ioc 
and move forward with smart city maturity should consid-
er the following best practices."
"a number of specific apps 
have been created to leverage the 
data, including planning tools for new 
building development and industrial 
development, and public safety 
monitoring."
"collectively, the smart longgang 
platform delivers an intelligent ecosystem 
of city management tools that are 
providing a safe city environment while at 
the same time leveraging the intelligent 
operating center for city administration, 
and smart sub-vertical solutions such as 
smart transportation, smart healthcare 
and smart citizen services."
"in idc’s case study research, 
many public safety organizations have stressed 
that organizations beginning on multiagency 
data sharing arrangements should pay special 
attention to governance."

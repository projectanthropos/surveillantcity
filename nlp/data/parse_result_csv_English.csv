Yanbu City, Saudi ArabiaGovernment

Yanbu, pilot city of Saudi Arabia’s ""Vision 2030"" initiative, is mandated to drive industry diversification.A port city close to the Red Sea, Yanbu’s transportation services occupy a high volume of its economy. Highly digitalized, the city is equipped with modern loading and unloading equipment.

Using ""Vision 2030"" as an opportunity, Yanbu decided to address its challenges by constructing a smart, digital city, 
and establishing an objective of 59 percent improvement in urban broadband fiber coverage. Additionally, Yanbu 
encountered various urban management services, complex interfaces, and long distances during the city network 
construction. Integrated and unified service transmission was essential. Yanbu sought a solution provider that 
specializes in full network planning and the ability to provide scenario-tailored devices to help the city achieve its 
Smart City vision.

Challenges

In 2017, the two-phase project focusing on smart urban management was launched. Huawei provided Yanbu with 
an overall network solution that achieved converged services, including:

 » Government office service network: The network connects the formerly siloed government departments, 
enabling rapid information exchange between departments. Additionally, the network enables major 
assignments across multiple departments to be centrally planned and assigned, greatly improving the 
government office efficiency.

 » Digital power network for buildings: Through the IoT sensor network distributed over office buildings, 
administrators can promptly collect power usage information for each area in a building, remotely control the 
supply of power, and uniformly switch on or off lighting devices and air conditioners. The digital power network 
helps save power.

 » Digital network for street lamps: Through AR IoT gateway controls, street lamps are digitalized so city managers

Yanbu City, Saudi Arabia Government

After two phases of the Smart City construction, The Royal Commission for Yanbu (RCY) received significant 
benefits from the digital network. The comprehensive public lighting system cost was reduced by more than 30 
percent, and road maintenance cost decreased by 20 percent. The rapid connection to the government network 
greatly improves the city’s public service level. Since the construction of the Smart City in 2014, the foreign 
investment growth rate has reached up to 16 percent, much higher than the previous 2.5 percent. Moreover, 
resident satisfaction has increased to 90 percent.

Customer Benefits

City network development is only the basic component of the Smart City construction, and live network 
applications are not the end of the city’s digitalization. Ayman, the CIO of RCY, said, ""A large amount of data 
generated by each application system presents a new RCY, helping us improve city governance in a more targeted 
and efficient manner,"" CIO of RCY Ayman said. ""I think it is just the beginning of Smart City. RCY will further 
collaborate with Huawei to provide citizens with better public services and make our city more attractive by 
leveraging new technologies.""

can rapidly and remotely modify network lighting policies. Moreover, the street lamp network can also be 
used to release emergency notifications and provide information about government incidents, business, and 
weather updates to citizens. In addition, the network can also be leveraged to deploy phones for emergency 
calls and video surveillance cameras. All services are uniformly and hierarchically backhauled on the network, 
greatly improving the residential experience.

 » IoT network for roads: With Huawei’s help, Yanbu deployed a communications network along roads across the 
city. On each road node, sensors are used to collect vehicle information, such as license plate numbers, speed, 
and weight. With this network, the traffic management department can instantly detect vehicles that violate 
laws or regulations, improving transportation safety while increasing traffic efficiency.

Figure

 With the non-registered population accounting for about 90% of the total, urban management was 

difficult. What's worse, insufficient surveillance coverage and difficult video information retrieval 

made it difficult to deal with the high crime rate and solve cases.

 The city lacked unified planning. The map information was inconsistent among multiple planning 

and management departments, causing long project planning periods and land and capital waste.

 Pervasive information silos led to low government approval efficiency. People had to visit multiple 

government agencies and wait for a long time before getting things done.

Challenges

 Data integration: Under the ""5+ architecture"" (device + network + library + graphics + cloud), 

aggregated data resources and built a district-wide unified basic database to create and share 

public information resources in a unified manner.

 Map integration: Built a two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and integrated spatio-temporal 

information sharing platform with 48 topic types and 421 data layers. This platform served as a 

unified portal to provide map services for departments.

 Smart governance: Based on the city characteristic, built ""7+1 sample applications"" covering city 

management, government services, multi-planning-in-one, and public security.

Section 1

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1 
Introduction
This report builds on and significantly extends the UK  
Smart Cities Index 2016. Since that report was published, 
there have been a series of global and local political changes 
reshaping the political and economic landscape in ways yet 
to be clear. This has only increased the focus on the role 
cities play in addressing some of the biggest challenges 
facing the country and its communities. In parallel, the 
momentum behind the development of smart or future cities 
continues to grow as UK cities look to exploit technology 
to address their social, economic, and environmental 
challenges. This interest in technology is accompanied  
by programmes for innovation in governance and process 
that will embed innovation at the heart of city policy.

The commitment of UK cities to innovation and service 
improvement is reflected in the expansion of this report 
to cover 20 cities at various stages of maturity in the 
development and execution of their smart city vision. 

1.2 
Emerging Trends 
The momentum behind smart cities is reflected in a growing 
understanding of what is required to accelerate the adoption 
of digital technologies. The research for this report identifies 
five key developments:

•  Bridging the gap between smart city programmes 
and strategic city priorities: Cities are building the links 
that will embed digital innovation in frontline services.

•  Supporting the emergence of city platforms: 
More cohesive strategies are being developed for the 
deployment of new technologies, including big data 
analytics and citywide Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.

•  Strengthening regional perspectives: As the extended 
scope of smart cities is recognised, smart city programmes 
are developing collaboration networks across combined 
authorities, county authorities, and regional agencies. 

•  Expanding the partner ecosystems needed to deliver 
a smart city vision: The increasingly important role that 
local universities are playing in shaping and developing 
urban innovation programs is one notable development. 

•  Developing more integrated approaches to  
city issues: A growing number of projects recognise  
the interconnection between transport, health, energy, 
and housing, for example, and the need to assess the 
impact of innovations across these traditional siloes. 

These positive developments are also leading to fresh 
assessments of the challenges facing cities. The impact 
of austerity measures and cuts in local government 
spending continue to be an important factor in shaping 
city polices, priorities, and the ability to adopt technical and 
organisational innovations. However, the most commonly 
cited challenges to the adoption of new approaches and 
new technologies are the ability and the appetite of local 
government to accept and manage the risk associated 
with innovation – in terms of the financial, organisational, 
cultural, and technical barriers presented.

“ Leading cities are bridging the gap 
between innovation programs and 
front-line service priorities.”

1.3 
Background to the Report

1.3.1 Aims of This Study
The aim of the UK Smart Cities Index is to provide an 
assessment of the current state of smart city development 
in the UK through a detailed comparison of the 20 leading 
smart cities. The evaluation highlights their strategies, key 
projects, and overall readiness to develop smart city visions. 
The study also highlights lessons to be learnt from early 
adopters and areas where cities, the national government, 
and other stakeholders need to act to accelerate smart city 
development in the UK.

1.3.2 Evaluation Method 
The 20 cities were selected on the breadth and depth  
of their smart or future city strategy and specific 
programmes in areas such as digital innovation, social  
care, urban mobility, energy, education, and sustainability. 
The assessment also looks at the extent of their partnerships 
and collaboration with other agencies and the private sector. 
A detailed comparison was made of the top 20 cities to 
identify the current leaders and their closest challengers. 

The evaluations in this report are based on Navigant 
Research’s corpus of smart city research; public documents 
on city strategies, projects, and performance; interviews with 
city leaders and project teams; and interviews with other key 
stakeholders in the development of smart cities from the 
public and private sector. 



UK Smart Cities Index 2017 | 5 

1.3.3 Evaluation Criteria 
The city evaluations for this Index are based on two 
dimensions: Strategy and Execution. The Strategy dimension 
assesses each city’s vision, goals, and objectives as they relate 
to its smart city programme. The Execution dimension assesses 
the city’s actual achievements, from initial projects to full-
blown deployment of innovative technologies and services.

Each dimension is split into five evaluation  
categories. The evaluation categories for the  
Strategy dimension are: 

•  Vision: Assesses the clarity, comprehensiveness,  
and depth of the city’s smart or future city strategy. 

•  Digital Innovation: Evaluates a city’s strategy to  
develop and exploit digital technologies and services. 

•  Service Innovation: Examines a city’s strategy for 
innovations in local services that exploit improvements 
offered by smart technologies.

•  Sustainability Plans: Assesses a city’s sustainability 
strategy and the explicit targets set for energy 
consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and related goals. 

•  Stakeholder Engagement: Examines the range of city 
stakeholders involved in the development of the smart  
city strategy.

The evaluation categories for the Execution  
dimension are:

•  Implementation: Assesses the city’s overall progress in 
translating its strategy into action based on the number, 
range, and extent of projects implemented to date. 

•  Digital Delivery: Evaluates progress on implementing  
the city’s digital strategy, including pilot projects,  
smart city demonstrators, and full-scale projects. 

•  Service Delivery: Evaluates progress on implementing 
service innovations defined in the city’s smart city strategy.

•  Environmental Impact: Looks at achievements against 
sustainability targets and implemented environmental  
and sustainability programmes.

•  Community Reach: Assesses engagement across 
multiple communities and stakeholders and the extension 
of projects into the wider city region.

Navigant Research scores the cities in the UK  
Smart Cities Index according to four categories;  
Leaders, Contenders, Challengers, and Followers: 

 Leaders
 These cities have differentiated themselves through 
the clarity, breadth, and inclusiveness of their smart 
city vision and planning. They are also leading the 
way in implementing significant projects at both  
the pilot and increasingly full-scale levels.

Contenders
 These cities have done much to establish their  
smart city strategies and have implemented  
some significant projects. However, there are  
still some gaps in their strategies, and the number 
of actual projects may fall behind that of the smart 
city Leaders.

Challengers
 Challenger cities have laid down a vision for 
their smart city endeavours and have begun to 
deploy projects, but execution still trails the vision 
outlined. They may have shown strong initiative 
in a few key areas but with less breadth in their 
programme than the leading cities.

Followers
 These are cities that are beginning their smart city 
journeys. They may have made initial statements 
of intent and begun limited pilot projects and 
siloed operations, but they need to develop a 
more integrated view for city development and/or 
stronger leadership for their programmes.

1 Executive Summary

1.4 
The UK Smart Cities Index 

1.4.1 Summary of Rankings
Bristol and London retain the Leader positions in this new assessment. Both cities are building on their existing programs  
and working hard to embed innovation across city operations, infrastructure, and service delivery. However, Bristol has  
edged ahead to take the top position, largely because of the strong momentum it has shown over the last 12 months. 

While Bristol and London retain the Leader positions, the Contender cities are also making significant progress, creating a 
strong cadre of UK cities that are putting digital innovation at the heart of urban development. The diversity of approaches 
among these cities is also producing a wealth of insights on both organisational and technological innovation.

The other cities assessed are at an earlier stage in their smart city journey, but are establishing their strategies and building  
on initial projects and initiatives. These cities have great potential to accelerate their programmes during the next 12 months.

In addition to leading practices, the research for this report 
identified several emerging trends as cities gain better 
understanding of their needs and how to exploit new 
technologies to better advantage:

1.5.2.1  Building Bridges between  
Innovation and Operations 

The leading cities have laid strong foundations for the 
development of innovation – both technically (in terms  
of test beds and platforms) and culturally (in terms of 
a trusted ecosystem of partners). The challenge now is 
to integrate this innovation culture with the day-to-day 
operations of the city. These cities are strengthening the 
links between innovation teams and city departments.  
Pilots and demonstrations are also being more closely 
aligned to city strategies and priorities. Closer collaboration 
is also developing between smart city or digital innovation 
teams and internal information and communications 
technology (ICT) functions, linking digital innovation 
agendas and the digitisation of backend city operations.  
At the same time, smart city programmes are going beyond 
initial seed funding to becoming an established element  
in city organisations, with stronger long-term governance 
and financing models.

1.5.2.2 Developing City Platforms 

Cities are developing more cohesive strategies for the 
deployment of new technologies, in particular, they are 
taking a more strategic view on the future deployment 
of IoT technologies and the necessary communications 
infrastructure. These cities have deployed or are planning 
large-scale deployments of low power networks, are vying  
to be test beds for 5G technologies, and are looking at 
future fibre needs to support these ambitions. They are 
moving beyond broadband programs for public buildings 
and Wi-Fi in the city centre to look at access requirements 
across the city, including less affluent and digitally  
excluded communities. 

1.5.2.3 The Regional Dimension 

The unbounded nature of smart cities is becoming widely 
recognised as smart city programs branch out to include  
a diverse group of local authorities and agencies – whether 
embracing new combined authorities or broader county-
based programs. This approach enables closer integration 
across a range of services for larger cities and new combined 
authorities and offers the benefits of scale when applying  
for funding or tendering for new services or solutions. It 
also enables smaller cities and towns to find greater scale in 
their programs as well as recognising the close relationship 
between a city and its local regions in areas such as 
economic development and travel infrastructure.

1.5.2.4 Extending City Partnerships 

There is a strong desire among city leaders to build  
more public-private sector partnerships. One of the most 
notable developments in this regard is the increasingly close 
relationships that smart city programmes are developing 
with local universities. Universities are not only providing 
research support but also are often active players in  
defining projects, securing funding, defining strategies,  
and contributing to or providing leadership of programmes. 
This is proving to be a win-win relationship as universities 
can show the effects of their work, gain access to real-world 
big datasets, and build closer bonds with local communities 
and decision makers.

1.5.2.5 A Holistic View on City Challenges 

The opportunity to take a more holistic view of city 
challenges is one of the foundational concepts of the  
smart city movement. However, it is much harder to 
achieve in practice. The leading UK cities are now taking 
their experience with diverse pilot projects to develop 
approaches that embed such a perspective in the design of 
programs, in the scoping of projects, and the measurement 
of benefits. Some cities, for example, are looking at the idea 
of smart districts or communities where the interconnection 
between transport, health, energy, housing issues, and 
innovations can be tested at scale. The work that the Future 
Cities Catapult is coordinating on Smart Planning can also 
help support a process that gives more consideration to 
interconnected dependencies in city design.

The UK Smart Cities Index provides an assessment of the overall progress of UK cities in their exploitation of smart 
technologies. However, it is also important to highlight specific developments across cities that are moving the bar in areas 
such as transport, health, and digital platforms. Table 1.1 highlights the cities that are leading the way in some critical areas. 
The Star Award reflects a particularly impressive range of innovations tied to a coherent strategy for further development. 
Competition is tough in all these categories and other cities that are close contenders are mentioned and deserve praise. 

1 Executive Summary



10 |  UK Smart Cities Index 2017

1.6.1 Transport 
Transport projects are the most common areas 
of focus for cities. Improvement in transport 
infrastructure and services have a major impact  
on economic development, social inclusion, air 
quality, and emissions reduction. Smart cities  
are looking at a range of issues and solutions 
including intelligent traffic management, 
mobility apps, sensor networks, EVs, hydrogen 
buses, AVs, congestion, and the impact of traffic 
on air quality issues.

Notable developments include:

•  Milton Keynes has led a diverse range of transport 
initiatives spanning mobility apps, EV and AVs, and a  
new intelligent traffic light management system.

•  Nottingham has a long-standing clean transport policy 
that spans its work on local transit improvements and low 
carbon vehicles.

•  Transport for London has been a leader in the sharing of 
data and the use of analytics; and London remains the leader 
in congestion charging and integrated ticketing. Greenwich 
is also establishing itself as a hub for transport innovation. 

Other notable initiatives include several transport innovation 
projects in Oxford, Edinburgh’s ambitious transport plan,  
and Cambridge’s work on real-time information services  
and an integrated transport programme. Cardiff’s citywide 
smart parking initiative is also worth noting. 

1.6.2 Health 
Cities are focused on improving health  
outcomes for all their residents. Support for 
an aging population and reduction in health 
inequalities, notably in terms of differences  
in life expectation between communities,  
are high priorities. 

Air quality is also high on the agenda for 
many cities as its effect on health becomes 
increasingly evident. The leading cities are 
developing relationships across care providers, 
including commissioning groups, NHS trust, 
academia, and social care providers. However, 
compared to transport, health and care systems 
are much more complex, involve many more 
agencies and suppliers, and have even more 
critical outcomes.

Notable developments include: 

•  Leeds continues to be a leader in exploring the possibilities 
of more integrated approaches to health and social care; 
the role of technologies in supporting people throughout 
their lives, and the importance of data in improving  
health outcomes. 

•  Birmingham, Manchester, and Nottingham are  
among the cities looking at the intersection of health 
issues with transport, housing, and energy. This is enabling 
a more holistic view on the development of smart and 
healthy communities.

•  Oxford and Cambridge are working with academic health 
bodies to develop new approaches to health programs that 
connect with wider smart city initiatives. 

Transport 
Transport projects are the most 
common areas of focus for cities.

Health
Cities are focused on improving  
health outcomes for all their residents.

1.6.3 Education and Learning Cities 
One of the significant trends identified in  
this study is the close relationship developing 
between local government and the university 
sector. All the cities covered in this study are 
working with universities to some degree to 
progress their smart city strategy, but a number 
stand out for the depth of the relationship  
and its impact on innovation programmes. 

Notable examples include the following:

•  Newcastle, where the University of Newcastle has 
taken a leading role in the establishment of Newcastle 
City Futures and in directing and supporting a range 
of innovation programs in the city – as well as the 
establishment of the Science Central facility. 

•  Oxford and Cambridge, which are building on the 
resources of their world-renowned universities to 
develop closer relationships between academia and local 
communities and councils – to the benefit of both sides. 

•  Bristol, which established Bristol Is Open as a JV between 
the city council and Bristol University – and which is using 
the university’s computing resources to underpin its smart 
city platform.

Other important partnerships include Milton Keynes with 
the Open University, Birmingham with the University of 
Birmingham and Aston University, Manchester’s work with 
its universities around the Manchester Corridor, and Leeds 
council’s work with the Leeds Data Institute. 

1.6.4 Energy 
Not only is energy policy a key element in  
any broader sustainability targets, it is also 
closely connected to transport, housing, and 
health policies. The new energy sector is also 
seen as an important economic growth area  
for many cities. 

Among the cities leading innovation in urban energy 
programmes are: 

•  Nottingham is building on its foundational energy 
innovation projects with new community energy schemes 
that include solar and storage programs. It is also looking 
at how energy improvements interact with transport  
and housing issues. 

•  Bristol has been another leader in the establishment 
of a city energy company and is also examining the 
intersection of energy with other areas such as transport 
and housing.

•  London is developing and testing a sustainable energy 
management system as part of the Sharing Cities project 
based in Greenwich.

•   Liverpool has been targeting energy efficiency, 
emissions reduction, and fuel poverty as part of a diverse 
programme that includes energy management for city 
buildings and the establishment of a city energy company. 

1 Executive Summary

Education and Learning Cities 
One of the significant trends is the close 
relationship developing between local 
government and the university sector.

Energy
Energy is becoming an increasingly 
important issue for many cities.



12 |  UK Smart Cities Index 2017

1.6.5  Public Safety and Resilience 
Public safety is a prime concern for all cities. 
Because of the criticality of these functions 
they are not generally a focal point for 
innovation programs – with research being 
done through other organisations, often  
at a national level.

The fact that most UK cities have already deployed  
extensive closed-circuit TV (CCTV) systems indicates the 
focus is now on coordination and the better use of video 
analysis and other forms of analytics. Some cities have 
established city operation centres to coordinate traffic and 
other city monitoring capabilities, most notably Glasgow 
with its state-of-the-art development. Bristol’s new 
city operations centre is also becoming the hub for the 
management of all city services.

A growing area of interest is the preparation of the city for 
the impact of climate change and extreme weather events. 
Oxford and Peterborough, for example, are both using 
sensor networks for flood detection. 

1.6.6 Sustainability
Many cities have set out ambitious plans 
to improve sustainability. This has not only 
driven a range of innovative programs for 
energy efficiency, but also new approaches for 
resource management, including a developing 
interest in the circular economy.

Notable examples include: 

•  Peterborough and Bristol have both established  
widely recognised environmental programs, which  
are embedding energy and environmental innovations  
in city services.

•   Low Carbon Oxford is bringing together a broad range 
of partners to meet city and regional environmental goals.

•  Manchester has declared that it will be a zero-carbon city 
by 2050 in response to the global requirements defined in 
the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Sustainability 
Many cities have set out ambitious 
plans to improve sustainability.

Public Safety and Resilience 
Public safety is a prime concern  
for all cities.

1.6.7 IoT
Leading cities are moving beyond a series of 
small IoT trials. First, they are looking closely  
at how they can quickly scale successful 
projects so that they make a real impact  
on the quality of life offered by the city. 
Secondly, they are looking to establish  
a testbed environment that can support a 
rolling programme of innovation projects.

Leading examples include:

•  Bristol Is Open has established a unique environment 
for solution testing, but Bristol has also made a significant 
effort to embed those projects in the wider city strategy.

•  Manchester has a great opportunity with CityVerve  
to establish itself as a leader in IoT innovation.

•  Milton Keynes is moving into a new project phase  
that will build on the IoT foundations laid out over  
the last 3 years.

•  Cambridge is also notable for the establishment of  
a LoRa network for the city in collaboration with the 
University of Cambridge. 

1.6.8 Data and Analytics
The rapid growth in the number of sensors  
and other intelligent devices deployed across 
the city landscape is creating an immense 
amount of new data that cities need to  
manage and learn to exploit to the benefit  
of all. All the cities included in this report  
are looking at how to use data to improve 
services and boost innovation.

Notable developments include:

•  London has established the London Office of Data 
Analytics (LODA) and appointed a Chief Data Officer  
to help accelerate the use of data to improve services 
across the capital.

•  Leeds has been a leader in open data for several years, 
with Data Mill North just one of several data-focused 
initiatives in the city, including the Leeds Institute for  
Data Analytics at the University of Leeds.

•  Bristol has upgraded its open data platform and is 
looking at closer integration with the new City Operations 
Centre. It has also created the Bristol Data Dome to 
demonstrate the value of city data.

1.6.9 Strategy
The successful adoption of new technologies  
to improve city services requires cities to  
rethink the way they design, manage, and 
operate city services in the digital age. Leading 
cities are taking a fresh view on the impact  
of technology on city policy making, planning, 
and service design. 

Innovative approaches include:

•  Aberdeen has committed to a new Target Operating 
Model, which seeks to embed smart city thinking into city 
planning, service design, and infrastructure investment. 
This will be enabled by new approaches to the provision  
of digital infrastructure and services.

•  Birmingham is now evolving its extensive strategic 
programme to accommodate the new possibilities  
offered by the newly combined authority and the  
regional perspectives that supports. 

•  Bristol and Milton Keynes are among the cities that 
are evolving their strategy to ensure closer links between 
innovation programmes focused on smart city technologies 
and the city’s operational teams. 

•   London is developing the London Office of Technology 
and Innovation, which aims to embed innovation deeper 
into operations across the GLA and London boroughs.

1.6.10 City Partners 
While the number of smart city programmes 
in the UK continues to expand, there are still 
many cities that are still at the beginning of 
their journey. Even the leading cities need 
support to keep pace with the rapid evolution 
of technologies such as 5G networks, machine 
learning, and automated vehicles, for example. 
Cities need partners at national level, in 
academia, and in the private sector to help 
them navigate this changing landscape. 

•   The Future Cities Catapult is having a strong influence 
across the country, helping cities initiate smart city 
programmes, share ideas and insight, develop common 
standards, and accelerate innovation in areas like  
Smart Planning.

•   Innovate UK’s support for innovation projects has been 
important in kick-starting smart city projects in many cities 
and continues to be an important source of funding and  
a catalyst for change.

•   The Scottish Cities Alliance has instigated the  
Scottish Smart Cities initiative (also called the 8th City 
programme) to help build on the momentum of smart  
city development in Scotland generated by Glasgow’s 
Future Cities Demonstrator. 

Strategy
Cities must rethink the way they design, 
manage, and operate services in the digital 
age to successfully adopt new technologies.

City Partners
Even the leading cities need support 
to keep pace with the rapid evolution 
of technologies.

1.7 
The Evolving Role  
of Central Government 
The continuing move towards the devolution of power 
and responsibility from central government to cities and 
regions is one of the most important influences shaping 
the development of city agendas, including their smart city 
ambitions. However, there continues to be an important 
role for UK government in the development of smarter 
cities across the country. This is demonstrated in the 
importance of the Future Cities Catapult and Innovate UK 
to the development of smart cities across the UK. Ensuring 
that the national digital infrastructure is adequate for the 
challenges of the future, must continue to be a responsibility 
of government (as reflected in the UK Digital Strategy and 
National Infrastructure Delivery Plan). There are three areas 
where central government can play a significant role, even 
within a model that emphasises devolution.

“ The biggest challenge for smart  
city initiatives is to overcome  
the well-founded risk aversity  
of local government.”

1.7.1.1 Underwriting Risk

One of the most common requirements of smart city teams 
from central government is support in helping cities accept 
and manage the greater risk involved in the large-scale 
adoption of new technologies or innovations in service 
design and delivery. 

There is still a need to bridge the gap between funding 
for demonstration projects and full-scale commercial 
deployments. It is still not clear how funding for pilot 
projects can evolve into support for the broader adoption  
of smart city technologies. 

Central government and its agencies should work with cities 
– and suppliers – to examine means for reducing, sharing, 
and managing the risks involved. This should encompass 
the funding burden of testing new solutions at scale, but 
also the means for balancing the risks against the potential 
benefits for all. 

Suppliers are also frustrated at the gap between pilot 
projects and the move to commercially sustainable models. 
There is an ongoing need to facilitate engagement between 
cities and suppliers and cross-industry groups like SmarterUK 
to explore how they can better manage the risks associated 
with large-scale deployments.

1.7.1.2 Addressing Procurement Issues

The debate continues as to how public sector procurement 
can be better designed to accommodate innovation, new 
technologies, and outcome-based approaches. This is not 
an issue restricted to the UK, similar challenges face cities 
across Europe and in other parts of the world. Whilst there is 
no easy solution to this challenge, there are some promising 
signs. Some cities, for example, are exploring the use of the 
Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) model developed 
by UK government to encourage the involvement of small 
to medium enterprises (SMEs) and others in research-based 
solutions to public sector challenges. 

1.7.1.3 Supporting Collaboration 

Devolution is already enhancing collaboration networks  
at a regional level. Other collaborative networks are  
also evolving; however, there still appears to be room  
for structured national programs for sharing insights  
and resources. 

Future Cities Catapult (and other Catapults) are making 
considerable efforts to address this. Programmes to support 
the use of AVs and the establishment of 5G test beds seem 
to be well coordinated. The work on Smart Planning was 
also commonly referenced as touching critical issues in 
smart city development. However, it is less clear that there 
are good structures for sharing development around city 
IoT developments. It is important that insights from projects 
like the Glasgow Future City Demonstrator and the current 
CityVerve project are shared and that city-led initiatives 
like MK:Smart, for example, are understood and valued by 
central government as a national resource. Where cities are 
addressing issues in parallel – as with air quality monitoring 
and management at present – a common directory of 
initiatives could be a useful resource.

1 Executive Summary



16 |  UK Smart Cities Index 2017

2.1 
The Evolution of the Smart City 
The smart city concept embraces some of the most critical 
challenges facing global society today, as well as a range  
of innovative technologies that present potential solutions. 
The smart city is a simple label for the complex forces 
shaping urban life in the 21st century. 

In Navigant Research’s definition:

“ A smart city is characterised by  
the integration of technology  
into a strategic approach to 
sustainability, citizen well-being,  
and economic development.”

The drivers behind the continued interest in smart cities 
include the continued growth in urbanisation, the need 
to reduce city emissions and better manage resource 
consumption, and growing economic, financial, and 
environmental pressures. These developments are entangled 
with rapid technology development in complex ways that 
present many opportunities for cities and suppliers. 

The growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) 
technologies and the decreasing cost of sensors and 
connectivity services are driving the wider deployment of 
smart devices, which further enriches the data available to 
users and managers of city services. Even without strong 
drivers for efficiency and sustainability, the city landscape 
would be in a process of transformation as it becomes as 
much a virtual environment as a physical one.

2.2 
Smart Cities in the UK
The movement towards smarter cities is firmly established 
in the UK. Many cities have long-standing strategies to 
focus on digital innovation, clean technologies, and service 
innovation in transport or health, for example, which 
provides a sound basis for broader smart city programmes. 
Central government initiatives have played an important 
part, notably in the £24 million Glasgow Future Cities 
Demonstrator, which catalysed many cities to develop smart 
city initiatives. Similarly, the 2016 IoT Challenge awarded 
to Manchester CityVerve galvanised a number of significant 
collaborations, not just in the winning city. 

The development of smart cities in the UK is closely 
connected to the continuing (and never-ending) debate 
over the relationship between the largest cities and the 
central government. In recent years, this has focused on the 
potential of the so-called Northern Powerhouse, based on 
greater devolution for the larger cities of northern England. 
This debate has now extended to other regions including 
the Midlands, with the Midlands Engine as a mirror the 
Northern Powerhouse, and the West Country (which now 
has a combined authority under a newly elected mayor). 
The recently elected mayors for combined authorities in city 
regions, including Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester, 
are already having an impact on the shape and scope of 
smart city programmes in those areas. Similarly, the election 
of a new mayor for London has led to a reinvigoration of 
the capital’s strategy to support the mayor’s goal of making 
London the smartest city in the world. Cities that have not 
chosen to have elected mayors, such as Newcastle, are no less 
affected as they look to counterbalance the strengths of their 
approaches and chosen route. Across different structures, city 
deals have been an important catalyst not only in releasing 
funds for infrastructure investment but also enabling more 
joined-up thinking across issues like transportation, housing, 
and economic development. Scotland has also established its 
own collaborative programme with Smart Cities Scotland, a 
work stream under the Scottish Smart Cities Alliance spanning 
the seven largest Scottish cities. 

These developments continue to take place under the 
shadow of tough and continuing cuts in city budgets,  
which is forcing city leaders to continuously examine 
all aspects of city operations in the search for increased 
efficiency and cost savings. Added to this are the 
uncertainties created by Brexit – with concerns already 
arising over future innovation funding and skills shortages.

Section 2

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE UK 
SMART CITY LANDSCAPE



UK Smart Cities Index 2017  | 17 

The UK has also been a leader in smart cities standards, 
beginning with the launch of the smart city framework in 
February 2014, developed under the aegis of the British 
Standards Institution with support from cities, governments, 
and suppliers. The Smart City Framework – Guide to 
Establishing Strategies for Smart Cities and Communities 
has been followed by specific studies to provide support in 
areas such as interoperability and data sharing and by the 
creation of the City Standards Institute within the Future 
Cities Catapult. The latest publication, PAS 184 Smart cities 
– Developing Project Proposals for Delivering Smart City 
Solutions, provides guidance on addressing some of the key 
challenges highlighted in this study, including the scoping 
of smart solutions, the need to overcome risk aversion, 
procurement practices, and benefits measurement.

2.3 
Assessing the State of Smart  
Cities in the UK 
The UK Smart Cities Index provides a snapshot of the 
development of smart city programmes across the leading 
cities in 2017. Detailed assessments are provided in  
Section 4, but some general trends are apparent across  
the evaluation criteria. 

2.3.1 Developments in Strategy and Leadership 
When establishing a smart city strategy, clear objectives  
and strong leadership teams are an important basis for 
most smart city programs. Many of the cities included in this 
assessment for the first time have made important advances 
by extending or strengthening their smart city leadership 
and overall framework. On the other hand, for those cities 
that are lagging in the Index, there is still work to be done 
to establish more robust governance models and more 
coherent overarching vision for their programs.

One of the most interesting developments in more advanced 
cities is a focus on strengthening links with the city’s broader 
social and economic targets, and building links with the city 
leadership team, IT departments, and frontline departments. 
Aberdeen, for example, is implementing an impressive 
new approach based around its target operating model. 
Birmingham – a leader in defining an inclusive smart city 
strategy – is now looking afresh at the implication of taking 
a broader regional approach, closely aligned to the strategy 
of the new combined authority and its elected mayor. 
Bristol, Cambridge, Leeds, Oxford, and Milton Keynes are 
also among the cities strengthening the links between 
smart city projects and city management. London’s recent 
appointment of Chief Data Officer and a new CIO role in 
Birmingham City Council are also indicators of the need for 
senior advocates for change within city leadership structures. 

2.3.2 Digital Innovation 
Digital innovation combines the development of city 
strategies for IT and communications technologies and 
specific projects to understand the opportunities they offer 
for improving city services through pilots and demonstration 
projects. There are now several cities with extensive test 
beds for new solutions, including established networks 
in Bristol and Milton Keynes, Manchester with CityVerve, 
and new networks in Cambridge and Greenwich. Cities 
like Aberdeen and Birmingham are also looking ahead at 
their strategic requirements. Leading cities are looking to 
go beyond initial investments in Wi-Fi in city centres and 
public buildings to broader strategies that support future IoT 
projects and other disruptive innovations such as automated 
vehicles (AVs) and the emergence of 5G networks. 

Cities continue to see data platforms as a key element 
in their strategy, although there is still some way to go 
to realise the more ambitious plans for data exchange. 
London has led the way with the London Datastore, and 
with its newly appointed Chief Digital Officer (CDO) can 
be expected to continue to be a leader with programmes 
such as the London Office of Data Analytics. Several cities 
have put in place shared data platforms including Bristol, 
Manchester, Milton Keynes, and Cambridge – which provide 
an important foundation for future developments.

It is important that cities ensure that all sections of the 
community benefit from smart city solutions. The cities 
covered in this report have programmes to address digital 
exclusion through training and active engagement. Many 
are developing co-creation programmes to involve residents 
and small businesses in the design of new services and the 
application of new technologies. 

2.3.3 Service Innovation 
One of the fundamental reasons for investing in smart city 
technologies is to deliver better and more efficient services. 
This means that digital innovation should be matched with 
service innovation. These new approaches span all aspects 
of city operations, including the use of telehealth and 
telecare to support social services, smart parking to reduce 
congestion, intelligent street lighting to reduce energy  
costs, and information services that allow residents and  
local businesses to be more involved in shaping their cities. 

City transport is an area of focus for all the cities covered 
in this report, with investments being made in changing 
mobility patterns, upgrading infrastructure, and exploring 
the impact of new technologies. Aberdeen, Cambridge, 
Edinburgh, Milton Keynes, and Nottingham are among the 
cities working on a range of transport initiatives. London 
has led the way with several groundbreaking investments, 
including congestion charging, a unified payment card, 
smart parking, bikesharing, and access to extensive transport 
data. Many of these are coming together in the projects 
supported by Digital Greenwich. Cardiff meanwhile is 
deploying a citywide smart parking system. 

2 Developments in the UK Smart City Landscape

In health innovation, Leeds is leading the way, working 
closely with local and national NHS organisations. Its 
ambition to be the best place to grow old in the UK is 
driving several large-scale projects that look at the impact 
of technologies on services for older residents. Liverpool has 
also made health a key focus area, exemplified by a new 
innovation centre at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital.

2.3.4 Sustainability 
UK cities have set a range of ambitious targets to reduce 
their carbon emissions and improve their use of resources. 
Most cities are committed to meeting the national goal  
of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, but  
there is considerable variation in their short- and medium-
term targets. 

Bristol has established its international credentials as 
the European Green Capital in 2015, and Peterborough 
continues with a strong focus on establishing itself as the 
UK’s Environment Capital. Nottingham is a leader in smart 
energy projects but Bristol, Liverpool, and London are also 
notable for their efforts to take more control over local 
energy production and consumption as part of their carbon 
reduction programs. London has also released an ambitious 
new environmental strategy for consultation. Manchester 
and Birmingham are among the cities also looking at new 
city energy ventures. 

Peterborough’s strategy for the creation of a Circular City 
is being supported through a collaboration platform that 
links local businesses and communities to improve energy 
efficiency, reduce resource consumption, and help boost  
the local economy.

Air quality is one of the issues that is being given greater 
priority in many cities. Several air quality monitoring  
projects have been deployed (notably in Cambridge and 
Leeds) – and cities are looking at congestion improvements,  
shifts to mobility patterns using better information services,  
and the accelerated adoption of low carbon vehicles. 

2.3.5 New Partnerships
An important facet of city strategies is the extension 
of their partnership arrangements with both the public 
and private sectors. Close relationships with academia 
are a notable attribute of most smart city programmes. 
Bristol, for example, is making use of Bristol University’s 
supercomputing facilities as well as relying on it to help 
manage its new experimental communications network. 
Milton Keynes has forged a close relationship with The 
Open University, which is playing a lead role in MK:Smart. 
Newcastle University has played a lead role in establishing 
Newcastle City Futures. Leeds University is also closely 
aligned with the city’s strong emphasis on the value of 
urban data and analytics. 

2.4 
Challenges and Barriers
Whilst the leading cities have some impressive success 
stories, smart city developments are still relatively immature. 
There are several issues that both the leading cities and 
those following them need to face.

2.4.1 Moving Beyond Pilots: Finance and Risk 
Local authorities are working under extremely tight financial 
settlements and are expected to continue to do more 
with less over the coming years. This situation restricts 
the ability of cities to provide their own upfront funding 
for demonstration projects and makes the transition to 
commercial operations more difficult. 

Smart city initiatives in the UK continue to rely heavily on 
innovation funding from the UK government agencies, 
research councils, and European regional infrastructure 
and R&D funding. Several programs have now evolved into 
more long-term support from city councils or through city 
deal programs. There are also closer links being established 
between smart city strategies and the policy goals and 
operational priorities of the city. However, there is still 
a significant gap between demonstration projects and 
implementation at scale. 

The most significant challenge facing aspiring smart cities 
remains how to transition successful pilots into full-scale 
projects. This will require cities and their delivery partners 
to work together to look at funding sources for initial 
investment and to develop well-founded business cases. 
There is a growing realisation that pilots and demonstration 
projects need to be designed from the outset to be able 
to test and develop business cases and to measure real 
outcomes that will provide the basis for wider deployment. 
Shifting the focus to the delivered benefits should make 
the path from pilot to wider deployment clearer for those 
projects, and prove their worth.



UK Smart Cities Index 2017  | 19 

2 Developments in the UK Smart City Landscape

2.4.2 Cultural Change 
One of the successes of UK smart city initiatives is the 
strong ecosystems that are being built among a wide range 
of partners. The challenge now is to build the internal 
processes and targets that can reduce the barriers to the 
introduction of innovation. The long-standing issue of siloed 
working is being addressed by cities taking a more holistic 
approach that understand the links between transport, 
health, and housing policy. 

One of the biggest challenges presented by a reduction in 
funding is in the lack of free resources in delivery departments 
able to work on innovation projects. Smart city and digital 
teams need experts in social care or transport, for example, 
who they can work with to deliver new solutions with long-
term benefits. These resources can be hard to find when 
departments are already tightly squeezed for staff and time. 

2.4.3  Improving Collaboration  
and Knowledge Sharing 

Both formal (Core Cities, regional partnerships, the Scottish 
Cities Alliance) and informal collaboration is improving 
between cities. The Future Cities Catapult and other 
Catapults are playing an important role, not least through 
standards development. But there is still room for better 
knowledge sharing on common problems. For example, 
many cities are looking at how to better monitor and 
manage air quality, and there could be value in a directory 
of projects or ways of sharing early findings (e.g., on sensor 
design and standardisation). Some areas seem to be better 
coordinated – for example, the work on AVs and 5G testing 
– but others are more difficult with the diverse solutions and 
use case around IoT. It is hoped that more lessons will come 
out of CityVerve. Regional partnerships – through city deal 
arrangements, LEPs, new combined authorities, and other 
structures – are also improving coordination on integrated 
strategies, knowledge sharing, bidding for project funds, 
and procurement.

2.4.4 Digital Infrastructure 
Cities are making important strides in deploying broadband 
communications, but there is still much to do. There is a 
strong appetite among cities to be at the forefront of 5G 
testing and to exploit the possibilities offered by low power 
networks. Cities will also benefit from the wider rollout of 
4G networks, high speed fixed broadband services, and low 
power networks, but city leaders, central government, and 
the communications industry need to ensure that the right 
options are in place to further develop citywide infrastructure. 
Further work is also needed to ensure the accessibility of 
services to all residents and to small businesses. 

2.4.5 Education and Understanding
The broad nature of the smart city concept can lead to 
misunderstanding and confusion. Smart city teams need to 
work with city leaders and managers to ensure a common 
understanding of the key objectives for any smart city 
programme, as well as the opportunities and challenges.  
The goal should be to embed the idea of smart capabilities 
into most major projects or service redesigns so that the city 
can benefit from both short- and long-term gains from a 
focus on data and connectivity. 

Cities need to engage local communities in all aspects  
of their smart city programmes, from initial strategy to 
project design and deployment. The leading cities are 
developing new models to involve their communities with  
an emphasis on the co-creation of services and digital 
inclusion programmes that show the local value of better 
data and the benefits of smart technologies.



20 |  UK Smart Cities Index 2017

3.1 
The UK Smart Cities Index 
This study shows the continued desire among UK cities to  
be at the forefront in the development of smart cities able  
to prosper in the age of digital and low carbon technologies. 

The extended scope of this report compared to the 2016 
report reflects the continuing expansion of smart city interest 
across the UK. This range is also reflected in the diverse 
levels of maturity shown in the report, from cities that are 
competitive with global leaders to cities in the early stages  
of defining their smart city strategy. 

The leading cities are now building on their foundation 
programmes to create stronger links between innovation 
projects and core city strategies. This encompasses new  
city strategies, closer links to other city departments, 
integration with city IT and digital agendas, and stronger 
sponsorship from city leaders. Cities at an earlier stage in 
their development are establishing strategies and policies  
to direct their smart city initiatives and provide framework 
for their R&D projects and service innovations. 

The technology landscape is also diverse. Cities are 
establishing platforms for innovation programmes and more 
integrated operational environments. IoT-based applications 
are becoming more widely deployed, as in the case of smart 
street lighting, but there are also a host of new technologies 
– the effects of which cities are grappling to understand 
– including AVs, 5G networks, and machine learning and 
other advanced data analytics.

This is also a period of change and uncertainty in the 
governance and function of UK cities. The impacts of 
devolution are still being worked through, and newly 
elected mayors are defining their programmes. Cities are 
also evolving their strategies to account for new regional 
implications and opportunities.

3 Summary of the Assessment

3.2.1 The Leaders 
Bristol and London retain the Leader positions in this new assessment. Bristol has edged ahead largely 
because of the strong momentum it has shown over the last 12 months across a range of initiatives. 
Both cities are building on existing programs and working hard to embed innovation across city 
operations, infrastructure, and service delivery. 

•  Bristol has made significant strides in extending its innovation programmes and in the closer 
integration of those initiatives into city operations. The establishment of a city operating centre 
closely aligned to those innovation programs is just one of the developments that is putting Bristol 
at the forefront of linking smart city innovations to city service delivery.

•   London’s smart city initiatives have been reinvigorated since the 2016 mayoral election, with strong 
commitments to smart city collaboration, increasing commitment to data-driven policy initiatives 
and an ambitious new environmental plan in development. There has also been considerable 
progress in several London boroughs, notably in the ambitious Digital Greenwich programme. 

3.2.2 The Contenders
The strength of UK smart city development is represented by the strong group of Contender  
cities that have well-defined, evolving strategies and an impressive array of innovation projects.  
These cities are now building on well-established programmes, creating stronger bonds between 
different stakeholders and looking to accelerate the wider deployment of successful solutions. 

3.2.3 The Challengers
The growing number of Challenger cities shows the breadth of interest in smart city development 
in the UK. The highest ranking cities are well-set to exploit the foundation work of recent years. 
Sheffield, Reading, Liverpool, and Belfast are all laying foundations and can be expected to make 
major strides in the coming year.

3.2.4 The Followers
Cardiff and Exeter have taken some important steps in their development as smart cities but there 
is still considerable work to be done in terms of developing a strategic programme and building the 
extensive ecosystem required to build an innovation environment.

4.1.1.2 Strategy

Bristol is the largest urban area in South West England,  
with a population of approximately 454,000 inhabitants. 
Bristol is part of the West of England Local Enterprise 
Partnership and of the new West of England Combined 
Authority. The area has one of the largest concentrations 
of microprocessor and network architects and strong local 
creative and digital media sectors. Despite its advantages, 
the city faces several challenges, including social inequality, 
congestion problems, housing issues and the need to 
improve employability and skills among its young people. 

The Council’s City Innovation Team works to pilot emerging 
smart city technologies. This team works with colleagues 
across all the authority’s functional areas, and with external 
partners, to demonstrate the potential of these new ways 
of working. The team also works closely with Bristol Is Open 
and the City Operations Centre to see the most valuable 
solutions tested and deployed at scale. 

A key element of Bristol’s smart city and innovation  
strategy is a focus on citizen-centric solutions. The city 
council along with the Knowle West Media Centre and 
Ideas for Change, launched a programme called The Bristol 
Approach, which aims to put communities at the heart  
of innovation. The Bristol Approach focuses on supporting 
people to work together to identify the knowledge, 
technology, and resources needed to tackle a problem.

The city is also focusing on the development of smart 
districts, where a more holistic view can be taken across 
issues like transport, energy, housing, and the potential 
use of new technologies and better data. The EU-funded 
programme REPLICATE is delivering just such an integrated 
smart district in the east of the city. 

4.1.1.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Bristol Is Open is a JV between the city and the University  
of Bristol to provide a unique city scale communications and 
data sharing platform. At the core of the project is an open 
high speed network that provides a platform for multiple city 
applications. The project integrates three networks through 
software controls: fibre in the ground, a wireless het-net 
along the Brunel Mile area of Bristol with Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, LTE, 
and 5G experiments, and a radio frequency mesh network 
deployed on 2,000 of the city’s lampposts. The plan is for the 
network to be extended into the wider city region over the 
next couple of years, creating an open programmable region 
reaching across Bath, South Gloucestershire, and North 
Somerset, an area covering more than 1 million people.

Another significant development is the implementation 
of the City Operations Centre to provide integrated 
monitoring and management of city services, including 
the following:

•  Traffic management and control

•  Closed-circuit TV (CCTV) monitoring  
for safety and security

•  Telecare services

•  Alarm monitoring

•  Out of hours call handling 

Additional operations will be added gradually to the centre, 
and talks with various agencies and service providers are in 
progress. The aim is to have a single place to control the 
way the city works. Data from the City Operation Centre will 
feed into the city’s open data platform. The data platform 
will open up the opportunity for businesses and citizens to 
develop and share information about the city, and to create 
new products or services.

There is close alignment between the work of the City 
Innovation Team, the City Operations Centre, and Bristol Is 
Open. The aim is to ensure innovation projects are focused 
on priorities facing the city and that there is pathway from 
pilot to broader implementation. 

Another example of the city’s focus on opportunities offered 
by big data is the Bristol Data Dome. The Data Dome is the 
result of a major upgrade to the city’s planetarium to create 
a stereo 3D hemispherical screen with 4K resolution. It is 
connected to a high performance computer at the University 
of Bristol via the Bristol Is Open network. The Data Dome 
will be used for a range of public and private sector projects, 
including the use of data visualisation to support complex 
city planning and investment processes.

The city has been actively involving the community in its 
smart city strategy. An interesting citizen-driven project 
is the Damp Busters pilot. It used The Bristol Approach to 
developed new ways of measuring the problem of damp in 
homes, including designing a frog-shaped temperature and 
humidity sensor. The Damp Busters pilot is part of a larger 
Citizen Sensing strategy. Citizen Sensing is a process where 
people build, use, or act as sensors – for example, identifying 
and gathering information (or data) that will help them 
to tackle an issue that is important to them. This sensing 
process could involve creating a bespoke temperature sensor 
from scratch or using a piece of technology that already has 
an in-built sensor, like a smartphone.

Several initiatives are addressing the transport situation in 
the city, which has one of the highest levels of car use in 
the country. Real-time data access on traffic conditions and 
transport services is being provided to help people make 
smarter travel decisions. A series of highly successful hack 
events have been hosted, and resulted in a range of new 
transport apps being developed. The city is also supporting 
the deployment of EV charging stations and is actively 
trialling the use of AVs.

4.1.2.1  Summary

London’s smart city initiatives have been reinvigorated following the 2016 mayoral 
election. The appointment of a CDO for London reaffirms the city’s leadership in the 
use of data to improve urban services. There has also been considerable progress in 
several London boroughs, notably in the ambitious Digital Greenwich programme, 
and in Westminster and Camden, for example. An ambitious new environmental 
plan, currently under consultation, should spur new citywide initiatives on priority 
issues such as air quality improvements.

26 |  UK Smart Cities Index 2017

4.1.2.2 Strategy

London’s size, wealth, global position, and continued 
expansion present unique advantage but also a series  
of distinct challenges. London is expected to be home  
to more than 11 million people by 2050. It benefits from 
its role as a centre for global finance, the base for leading 
technology companies, and home of world-renowned 
universities. However, it also faces a range of problems 
in terms of environmental pressures, infrastructure 
requirements, economic and social inequality, and  
a complex governance structure. 

Responsibility for London’s evolution towards a smart city is 
shared between the Mayor of London, the Greater London 
Authority, and the 33 London boroughs. The appointment 
of a new CDO for London is expected to drive greater 
collaboration across the London boroughs on a range of 
smart city and digital innovation programs. A London Office 
of Data Analytics (LODA) pilot has been underway since 
2016 and there is also an exercise underway to scope a 
London Office of Technology and Innovation (LOTI). The 
aim of LOTI is to focus on the potential of data and digital 
technology to deliver real outcomes for London’s frontline 
public services. 

The Smart London Board, established in 2013, has also  
been refreshed in 2017. The board plays an advisory role  
to the mayor and the new CDO, with members from across 
the public sector, academia, leading technology suppliers, 
and small businesses.

4.1.2.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

London was an early proponent of the benefits of open  
data for urban innovation. The city took a strong lead with 
the establishment of the London Datastore and an extensive 
programme to encourage developers to use this data, 
with Transport for London being particularly notable for its 
collaboration with third parties. The focus in London is now 
on the quality and use of data to improve services and to 
achieve priority outcomes. For example, Westminster  
Council is leading a pilot project for LODA that uses 
combined data from across London boroughs to address 
the issue of problem landlords by enabling more efficient 
and effective inspection programmes. Several data mapping 
projects have also added new insights on London’s assets, 
infrastructure, and services, including a London Heat Map, 
which supports energy efficiency and renewable energy 
initiatives. The London Development Database provides 
map-based access to data about the major planning 
permissions across London. The London Infrastructure 
Mapping Application is an online tool aimed at increasing 
coordination around infrastructure delivery and facilitating 
strategic planning across the capital. The current database 
contains over 12,000 infrastructure and construction 
projects that are underway, planned, or proposed.

London has a well-established commitment to reducing 
its carbon emissions. Its Low Carbon Capital strategy set a 
target to reduce carbon emissions by 60% by 2025 against 
1990 levels, and to deliver 25% of its electricity from local 
renewable sources. A draft of the new London Environment 
Strategy was released for consultation in August 2017. This 
reaffirms existing targets but also advocates for the first time 
a joined-up approach across all relevant sectors – including 
energy, water, waste, transport, and buildings. One of the 
highest profile areas is air quality – which is a major focus for 
the new administration. An online consultation on air quality 
in the city has already gathered over 15,000 responses. The 
Mayor is also developing an energy supply company, Energy 
for Londoners, to develop clean and smart, integrated 
energy systems using local and renewable energy resources. 
The aim is to make London a zero-carbon city by 2050. 

The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is developing a new 
smart district data infrastructure standard for a zero-carbon 
community, supported by technologies such as 3D mapping 
and virtual reality. There have been several IoT and sensor 
projects delivered on the Park which have focused on 
the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data, 
alongside studies relating to citizen engagement. The latest 
experiment is to have an autonomous (driverless) shuttle bus 
trial running on the Park.

Inevitably, there is great diversity in approaches to smart 
city development across the London boroughs, with each 
borough focusing on its own priorities and possibilities. 
Notable programmes include Camden’s Digital Camden 
strategy and a series of data and technology projects in 
Westminster, including the deployment of smart parking 
technologies. One of the most ambitious programmes has 
been launched by the Royal Borough of Greenwich, led by 
the Digital Greenwich team. The borough is home to several 
advanced transport innovation projects. 

Greenwich is also the London demonstration area for 
Sharing Cities, a €25 million EU Horizon 2020 project led 
by London, Milan, and Lisbon. The 3-year project, launched 
in January 2016, is developing, deploying, and integrating 
replicable solutions across the energy, transport, data, and 
information and communications technologies (ICT) sectors. 
The London projects include energy efficiency, renewable 
energy, urban mobility, and smart parking projects. One 
of the most ambitious projects is the development of a 
sustainable energy management system (SEMS) that is 
consolidating and analysing energy data from smart meters 
and other intelligent devices, to optimise energy production 
and consumption at a community-level. The SEMS also links 
to the broader urban data platform being developed as part 
of the Sharing Cities programme.

4.1.2.4 Digital Greenwich 

The Royal Borough of Greenwich established Digital 
Greenwich as an in-house multidisciplinary team to help 
develop, implement, and manage its smart city strategy and 
initiatives. The Borough recognises that digital technology 
will be needed to help deliver modern infrastructure and city 
services, particularly in consideration of its strong population 
growth – Greenwich’s population is expected to rise by 
34% between 2010 and 2028. Four primary areas are 
targeted for transformation as part of Greenwich’s smart city 
strategy: neighbourhoods and communities; infrastructure; 
public services; and the Greenwich economy.

As well as being the London site for the Sharing Cities 
project, Digital Greenwich is also host to several other 
demonstration projects, including: 

•  Move_UK, which is a consortium of automotive 
companies (led by Bosch) developing automated driving 
systems in the UK. The three-year project received a £5.5 
million grant from Innovate UK to trial AV technology 
in real-world conditions in Greenwich, and aims to 
accelerate deployment of AVs in the UK. 

•  GATEway, also funded by Innovate UK, is led by TRL 
(the UK’s Transport Research Laboratory) and is focused 
on understanding public and industry perceptions and 
acceptance of AVs through demonstrations and user 
engagement. The £8 million initiative is technology 
agnostic, and aims to demonstrate safe and efficient 
integration of automated transport systems. 

Additionally, the UK Smart Mobility Living Lab is also located 
in Greenwich, largely used for developing connected 
and automated vehicles in a real-life environment. 
Digital Greenwich also runs an innovation centre in the 
borough which connects businesses with local smart city 
programmes, other companies, and nearby universities. 
The centre is a showcase for clean technology – utilizing 
renewable energy, rainwater harvesting, and ground source 
cooling systems to achieve a carbon footprint of 35% below 
building regulations.

4.2.1.2 Strategy

Manchester is a central player in the emergence of the 
Northern Powerhouse, which aims to devolve more power 
to cities and close the economic divide between the North 
and South of Britain. As part of the new deal between  
the central government and the city region, the election  
of the first directly elected mayor for Greater Manchester  
in 2017 brings more devolution and fiscal power to the 
region. The city’s vision is that, “by 2025 Manchester will  
be among the top 20 smart cities in the world.”

Manchester’s smart city strategy is coordinated through 
the Manchester Smart City programme, which has the six 
themes aimed at delivering better outcomes for the city  
and its citizens: Live, Work, Play, Move, Learn, and Organise. 
Each smart city project has a bias towards one or two of 
these areas but also connected with each of the others  
in some way.

In 2015, a consortium led by the city council was awarded 
£10 million to implement the CityVerve IoT Demonstrator 
project. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the 
capabilities of IoT applications at scale across a city region. 
The demonstrator project is giving Manchester the chance 
to further enhance its international position as a pioneer in 
the use of new urban technologies, as well as new forms of 
local governance. Underpinning Manchester’s winning bid 
was its established digital strategy, ambitions for regional 
devolution, and network of corporate partners including 
Siemens, Cisco, and BT.

After the Paris Agreement on climate change, Manchester 
announced a commitment become a zero-carbon city by 
2050, this has been formalised in the city’s climate change 
strategy. The Manchester Climate Change Strategy 2017-
2050 and the Implementation Plan for 2017-2022 were 
launched in December 2016. 

4.2.1.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

The CityVerve demonstrator project aims to deploy the 
latest IoT technologies at city scale to deliver transformative 
benefits: new business and jobs, better healthcare, transport 
and education, and more engaged and empowered 
citizens. The project is making smart improvements to city 
infrastructure and services and includes community wellness 
initiatives, air quality monitoring, a cycling safety scheme, 
and talkative bus system. The £16 million project is backed 
by Innovate UK, which contributed £10 million through an 
IoT Demonstrator Award, and the rest is provided by private 
partners. Over 21 organisations from the public, corporate, 
and academic sectors are supporting the project.

Triangulum is a 5-year, €25 million European Commission 
Horizon 2020 project involving Manchester; Eindhoven,  
the Netherlands; and Stavanger, Norway. The aim of the 
project is to examine the impact of smart solutions on low 
carbon development, including reduced energy consumption 
in buildings, increased use of renewable energy, increased 
utilisation of EVs, deployment of intelligent energy 
management technologies, and the deployment of an 
adaptive and dynamic ICT data hub.

Manchester is also involved with the European Commission 
EU-China Smart Cities Forum project. An agreement is in 
place between several organisations involved in the UK-
China smart cities initiative to develop a Joint Smart Cities 
Laboratory, colocated in Manchester and Shanghai. The 
three universities of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan, 
and Salford, along with eForum, are establishing a smart 
cities laboratory in Manchester. Digital China is funding  
the Jiao Tang University to setup a similar initiative to foster 
deeper collaboration around current and future best practice 
in smart city design and technologies. The involved parties

4.2.2.1  Summary

Birmingham’s smart city programme is moving into a new phase as it seeks to more 
closely integrate its digital innovation programmes and city’s operational activities. 
Working closely with other agencies across the West Midland combined authority 
is also becoming an important shaper for smart city infrastructure investment and 
other digital enables. New projects to extend the role of data in city policy making, 
like the Big Data Corridor and Driven Interactive Smart City (DISC), are indicators of 
the next stage in making digital innovation a core element in the city’s strategy.

4.2.2.2 Strategy

The Metropolitan Borough of Birmingham is home to more 
than 1.1 million people and is the second largest city in 
the UK. Birmingham sits at the heart of the West Midlands 
region and combined authority, which is made up of seven 
metropolitan boroughs including the cities of Birmingham, 
Coventry, and Wolverhampton. As a growing city that 
is expected to increase in population by 10% by 2026, 
Birmingham faces challenges in providing infrastructure 
and housing, and in developing local skills to meet the 
requirements of the city’s new and evolving businesses.

Birmingham’s smart city strategy has its roots in the 
work of Birmingham Smart City Commission, created 
by the Birmingham City Council in 2012 and involving 
representatives from business, academia, and the public 
sector. The Commission was responsible for developing  
the city’s initial smart city roadmap, which was then refined 
through a process of consultation with other stakeholders. 
The city is now in the process of revising and updating 
its smart city strategy, shaped in part by its new ICT and 
Digital Strategy and even closer collaboration with other 
stakeholders in the West Midlands Combined Authority.

Digital Birmingham is the council organisation responsible 
for coordinating overall progress against the city’s smart city 
roadmap, working with the various city delivery agencies 
and partners. There is a strong digital component in the 
smart city strategy and a strong emphasis on embedding 
digital perspectives on city operations, new infrastructure 
investments, and citizen services.

Birmingham is also looking to develop an Innovation 
Advisory Group, including representatives from local 
universities, major suppliers, SMEs, and other agencies. 
The aim of the group is to help the council identify more 
disruptive innovations that can help improve services.  
This is part of a wider strategy to accelerate the adoption  
of new ideas and solutions within the city.

4.2.2.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Current and planned projects in Birmingham span  
most aspects of city operations. Birmingham has several  
different programmes and initiatives revolving around data. 
The Birmingham Data Factory is a platform for accessing  
the city’s open datasets. Data is currently available from  
the city council (which has an open-by-default policy), 
Centro (the West Midlands transport providers), and other 
agencies. The plan is for the Data Factory to become an 
information marketplace for use by diverse data providers. 
The West Midlands Open Data Forum brings together data 
experts, enthusiasts, and developers from across a variety  
of sectors that are actively using the data available. 

In 2017, Digital Birmingham launched two new data 
initiatives: Big Data Corridor and Data-DISC decision support 
toolkit. Big Data Corridor is a grant funded programme in 
conjunction with the European Development Fund, Aston 
University, Birmingham City University, and other partners to 
help SMEs benefit from access to technical and commercial 
support for exploiting data. DISC is a collaborative project 
involving Birmingham City University, Digital Birmingham, 
Future Cities Catapult, and private sector partners, and 
aims to simplify complex decision-making, informing policy 
and strategic service developments using unified data, 
simulation, and modelling. 

Birmingham is also one of the cities involved in the EU 
Horizon2020 project, City4Age. The programme is looking 
at the use of digital technology to improve the support for 
the frail and elderly population within urban communities.

Smart Routing is a new smart transport initiative. Smart 
Routing is a trial software platform built into Birmingham’s 
existing Commuter App that uses real-time transportation 
data and personal data to support more efficient 
transportation planning, even when users are offline. 

One of the most ambitious programmes in the city is the 
East Birmingham Smart City Demonstrator, where various 
smart city concepts and technologies are being developed 
relating to mobility, health, skills, enterprise development, 
and information marketplaces. This builds on the initial 
smart city roadmap and will have a strong focus on 
outcomes that have an impact on the local community 
rather than technology pilots. 

The city council’s Green Commission established the city’s 
carbon target as a 60% reduction in total emissions by 2027 
and 80% by 2050 from 1990 levels. A number of energy 
and sustainability projects have already been implemented. 
The existing Birmingham District Energy Scheme is being 
extended through the city centre, and there are plans to 
establish a city energy services company.

Throughout the city’s various programs and initiatives, 
Birmingham has involved local universities and SMEs.  
The city also plays host to incubator projects, including the 
Energy Research Accelerator, which is supported by several 
universities in the West Midlands, the national Energy 
Systems Catapult, and Serendip Smart City Incubator,  
which supports startups in digital health, mobility, IoT,  
and smart cities. 

The city has been investing in its digital and data 
infrastructure. Public Wi-Fi is available across the city centre 
following a project between the Birmingham City Council 
and Virgin Media Business; Wi-Fi has also been installed in 
over 200 public buildings. A consultation is now taking place 
as to future connectivity needs of the region, including low 
power networks and future possibilities for 5G networks, 
with the aim of ensuring seamless communication support 
for services across the region.

Leeds is laying down strong foundations to enable data and technology to support 
its goals as a city. This is most evident in its focus on integrated approaches to 
developing health and care services. It has built strong collaborative networks 
to achieve this, as it has also done in the development of Data Mill North and 
its broader data strategy. It is now looking at the requirements for robust city 
communications that can underpin future development across a range of IoT  
and other technology innovations. Common leadership for digital transformation 
and smart city innovations also enables Leeds to ensure closer alignment between 
innovation programs and the priorities for city services.

4.2.3.2 Strategy

Leeds is at the heart of one of the UK’s largest metropolitan 
regions. It is the second largest unitary council in the country, 
covering a population of around 775,000. It sits at the heart 
of the Leeds City Region, encompassing 3 million people 
across West Yorkshire.

Leeds City Council’s ambitions are defined by its goal to be 
the best city and best council in the UK by 2030. Its strategy 
embraces all aspects of city operations as well as ambitious 
environmental goals. Digital technologies and better data 
are key elements in achieving these goals. Leeds is building 
on its close relationships with the NHS, the capabilities of 
the University of Leeds, and a diverse range of partners that 
have made Data Mill North one of the most advanced open 
data platforms in the country.

One of the most notable priorities is Leeds’ commitment 
to improving services for older residents. The city recently 
refreshed its Health and Wellbeing Strategy (2016-2021) to 
include an Age Friendly Smart City project with the objective 
of developing robust technology solutions that can empower 
older residents and make Leeds the best city to grow old 
in. To achieve these and other goals, there is a growing 
emphasis on the need for a citywide perspective that takes 
in all aspects of the city, not just council-delivered services. 

The city’s smart city initiatives are steered by a Smart City 
Board that reports to the city council. The Board includes 
representatives from city departments and relevant teams, 
and is chaired by the city CIO. A set of digital principles have 
been agreed upon to help ensure that the opportunities 
offered by digital technologies are given due consideration in 
the early stages of planning and the design of new projects. 

4.2.3.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

The development of open data and data analytics continues 
to underpin the Leeds smart city initiative. The Leeds Data 
Mill, now Data Mill North, was one of the first platforms 
in the UK to bring together open data information from 
multiple sectors and to enable that data to be accessed 
for analysis and to develop new service solutions. Data 
Mill North is part of several data-focused initiatives in the 
city, including the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics at the 
University of Leeds and the work of NHS Digital, which is 
based in the city. 

One example of the city’s approach to integrated healthcare 
is the Leeds Care Record. This is an integrated system 
to provide health and social care practitioners in the city 
with an integrated view of patient information. General 
practitioners, for example, have direct access to patient 
hospital reports as part of a single application.

Leeds is a partner in the EU’s ActiveAge, Horizon 2020 
project. Leeds is focusing on two core use cases as part 
it involvement: independent living support and personal 
health and symptoms monitoring. The Leeds consortium is 
deploying energy monitoring equipment along with home 
sensors and smart multifunctional wearables (smart watches) 
to provide services around fall detection, emergency triggers, 
remote monitoring of vital health stats, and other detection 
system to help give confidence for elders to sustain their 
lives in their homes for a longer time. The Leeds team has 
already recruited around 1,000 residents for the project. 
Other digital inclusion initiatives include a tablet-lending 
scheme managed through the city’s library service and  
an initial deployment of broadband and Wi-Fi in social 
housing schemes.

The Assisted Living Leeds Innovation Lab (ALL IN) is an 
example of a project to drive innovation within the field 
of assistive technology. It enables innovators and product 
developers to connect with end users of assistive technology, 
and with health and social care professionals. 

The city has also been investing in its communications 
infrastructure, with free Wi-Fi now available in over 200 
public buildings. The city is now looking to extend Wi-Fi 
further across the city as part of a broader strategy to 
prepare for the wider deployment of IoT solutions and the 
coming of 5G networks, including an assessment of future 
fibre network requirements. A LoRa low powered network  
is being deployed and a SIGFOX network is also available.

rolling on under new funding arrangements, which will see more active engagement 
from a broader range of commercial partners. The breadth of Milton Keynes work  
on transport innovation is particularly notable, spanning EV support, AV trials,  
real-time mobility data, and citizen mobility apps. The challenge is to move to  
larger-scale deployments – beginning with the Vivacity parking and traffic 
management system – and to accelerate local adoption of successful solutions.

4.2.4.2 Strategy

The MK:Smart programme serves as the foundation of 
Milton Keynes’ development as a smart city. The programme 
was set up to develop innovative solutions to support 
economic growth, reduce carbon emissions, and improve 
services in the city. MK:Smart is a collaborative initiative 
that was partly funded by the Higher Education Funding 
Council for England and led by The Open University, the 
Milton Keynes Council, and BT, with support from a number 
of technology partners. In June 2017, the funding phase 
for MK:Smart officially finished. However, the brand and 
the programme will continue. The council has committed 
an additional investment of £500,000 to continue the 
programme for another 2 years, principally to support the 
development and maintenance of the core infrastructure 
and the Data Hub portal. The programme is also extending 
its relationship with other partners including BT, Huawei, 
and Tech Mahindra. The Open University will continue to 
play a key role in directing the programme. 

The MK Futures 2050 Commission was established to  
develop a view of the long-term future for the city and  
make recommendations for council policy to match this 
vision. The Commission published its report and final 
recommendations for Six Big Projects in July 2016, all  
of which were supported by Milton Keynes Council.  
The development of the MK:Smart programme is being 
aligned with the major projects highlighted in MK Futures 
2050, which span economic growth, the establishment 
of a new technical university, an emphasis on education 
improvement: smart, shared, and sustainable mobility; the 
renaissance of the city centre; and development of a creative 
and cultured city.

4.2.4.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Milton Keynes was one of the first urban regions to 
implement a network based on IoT technology. In 2013, 
a consortium of infrastructure providers, SMEs, and 
government-backed innovation centres established the  
UK’s first citywide low power wireless access network. 
Recycling bins and parking spaces were among the first 
things to be connected to the Internet, and the deployment 
of sensors has been extended to include initiatives such as 
people presence and soil moisture in parks. Sensors are also 
being used to monitor transport, energy, waste collection, 
and water systems as part of the demonstration projects.

The MK Data Hub provides the data infrastructure for the 
MK:Smart project, supporting the collection, integration,  
and use of data across multiple applications. This includes 
data about energy and water consumption, transport, 
pollution, social and economic datasets, and crowdsourced 
data from social media or specialised apps. The Data Hub 
currently has over 700 datasets that are being used to  
support intelligent planning and utilisation of resources  
across Milton Keynes’ city services. The hub includes advanced 
arrangements for the governance and management of data 
and easy access for developers through smart APIs. 

Transport and urban mobility is one of the key focus areas 
for innovation in the city. MK:Smart is promoting the 
concept of Cloud-Enabled Mobility. This project connects 
users with real-time data to enable informed local travel 
decisions (e.g., booking and billing systems), which can 
reduce time wasted and traffic congestion. The information 

is made available to the public via a new citywide app 
known as MotionMap (a user trial started in April 2017).  
The next phase of the project will involve analysing the 
findings from the user trial, as well as using MotionMap 
to enable new forms of public transport such as AVs and 
mobility on-demand. 

In October 2016, the first AV demonstration in Europe took 
place in Milton Keynes as part of a 3-year demonstration 
project – UK Autodrive. Among the partners in the 
consortium are Jaguar Land Rover, Ford, Tata, the University 
of Oxford, and the University of Cambridge. New protocols 
are expected to be developed for AVs, as well as the 
continued testing of the public reactions to both driverless 
cars and fully automated, self-driving pods for pedestrianised 
spaces. The UK Autodrive project has announced a goal 
of having 40 of these pods operational as a limited public 
service by summer 2018. 

The first AI-enabled traffic management system in the 
world will be deployed in Milton Keynes by autumn 2018. 
Supported by an Innovate UK first-of-a-kind grant, Vivacity 
Labs will install 2,500 video sensors to monitor major 
intersections and 13,000 surface car parking spaces to 
reduce traffic congestion. When fully deployed, the system 
will be able to dynamically prioritise emergency vehicles, 
buses, and cyclists when appropriate. 

MK:Smart is also looking at ways to improve energy 
efficiency in the city. Several initiatives are underway or 
recently completed, including the FALCON smart grid 
project, a comprehensive EV charging infrastructure 
network, wireless induction charging for bus services, 
and a district heating system. Additionally, as part of the 
Community Action Platform for Energy project, an Open 
Energy Map is being built to better understand local energy 
trends and generate community energy projects. 

In addition to the array of technical solutions being 
developed, MK: Smart also offers an integrated programme 
of business, education, and community engagement. An 
Innovation and Incubation Centre at University Campus 
Milton Keynes is designed to integrate training and support 
for data-driven business innovation and the digital economy, 
with hands-on support for business development at the 
point of need, virtual and physical demonstration facilities, 
and an incubation space.

4.2.5.2 Strategy

Glasgow’s smart city ambitions received a significant 
boost when it was awarded the £24 million Future City 
Demonstrator grant in 2013. The award has been used to 
fund a series of projects across the city that aim to improve 
the lives of Glasgow citizens and to establish the city as 
a centre of urban innovation. Whilst the Demonstrator 
projects were completed at the end of 2015, Glasgow’s 
smart city development has expanded through the Scottish 
Cities Alliance, for which Glasgow is leading the Smart Cities 
Scotland workstream. 

4.2.5.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

The Future City Demonstrator has been the main programme 
for smart city innovation in Glasgow, with projects covering 
data, energy, building innovations, and lighting. 

A key development has been the new Glasgow Operations 
Centre, which accounted for nearly half of the total 
programme funding from the Future Cities Demonstrator. 
The centre has a state-of-the-art integrated traffic and 
public safety management system, enabling the city to 
take proactive approaches and have real-time responses to 
managing city services such as public space CCTV, municipal 
building security, traffic management, and police intelligence. 

Open Glasgow is the platform developed to share public 
sector datasets from the city council and other organisations 
and to provide a gateway to the city dashboard, an online, 
personalised dashboard that presents real-time data to 
citizens. In addition, the Data Launchpad provides a platform 
for multiple organisations to share data that can help 
provide insight into the city. 

Glasgow’s smart city initiatives also promote digital 
inclusion. The city worked with the Wheatley Group to 
complete two pilot projects, which provided low cost 
broadband to its social housing tenants. The first pilot 
included 12 homes experimenting with three technical 
options for Internet access; hardwire broadband, Wi-Fi,  
and Ethernet over power lines. This was followed by a 
second, larger pilot checking Wi-Fi connectivity in a multi-
storey block with 138 units. Results from the pilots show 
large increases in Internet and email usage, as well as higher 
confidence using the Internet by the tenants. The city is also 
running a Digital Apprentices programme to increase the 
digital skills of young people starting their careers. Finally, 
the city has set up 36 Click and Connect computer learning 
centres to help more residents get online. 

The city has several significant energy and sustainability 
projects underway. The Glasgow City Energy Model maps 
the energy consumption of residents and businesses across 
Glasgow in 2D and 3D, these can be viewed by residents  
on the web portal or through the Energy App developed  
as part of the demonstrator. The app can recommend 
retrofit options to users that will make their home more 
energy efficient. The city has several building energy 
management projects, including pilots that use sensor 
technologies to measure ambient temperature and humidity 
levels, and the use of demand-side management for city 
council properties (in collaboration with Siemens and 
ScottishPower Energy Networks). 

Smart street lighting is one of the other successful pilots 
initiated under the Future City Demonstrator. Three smart 
street lighting pilots have been deployed at Riverside 
Walkway, Gordon Street, and Merchant City. The smart 
street lights are improving energy efficiency and are also 
being used to support other applications such monitoring 
movement (footfall and traffic flow), air, and noise pollution 
levels. The plan is to now extend the street lighting to the 
rest of the city, working in conjunction with other cities as 
part of Smart Cities Scotland.

Glasgow has also laid out a detailed transport plan in its 
Glasgow City Centre Transport Strategy (2014-2024) report. 
In addition to public transport infrastructure improvements 
such subway modernisation, the strategy prioritises walking 
and cycling. The report also highlights the role of improved 
traffic management and parking strategies, smart and 
integrated ticketing, and low emissions zones.

Glasgow is the lead partner for the Smart Cities Scotland 
workstream for the Scottish Cities Alliance. Under the 
programme, Glasgow is involved in projects in the areas of 
smart street lighting, data, smart waste, water management, 
and smart communities.

4.2.6.2 Strategy

Nottingham has a population of around 314,000 and is at 
the heart of a region of nearly 756,000. City leadership has 
set a strong emphasis on energy and transport policy, and is 
also focused on making Nottingham one of Europe’s leading 
cities for science and innovation. 

The city is now developing a coordinated smart city 
framework that will bring broader cohesion to the wide 
range of current and projects city innovation programmes 
around the theme of creating a smart and liveable city. The 
four focus areas are clean, sustainable, and low cost energy, 
mobility (including addressing air quality and congestion 
challenges), improvement in district health (in particular 
inequalities in life expectancy), and housing improvements. 
The city’s two universities – the University of Nottingham 
and Trent University – are partners and co-leaders in the 
development of the smart city strategy.

Energy sustainability has been a priority for Nottingham  
City Council since it published a 10-year action plan strategy 
in April 2010. This action plan included generating more 
local energy via solar PV and biomass combined heat and 
power (CHP) systems, as well as through cutting demand. 
Nottingham now claims it is both the most energy self-
sufficient and least car-dependent city in the country.  
The Nottingham City Council has direct control over much  
of the city’s infrastructure, transport, and housing stock, 
which it believes is an important factor in being able to 
deliver a smart city in practice.

4.2.6.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Nottingham has strong ambitions to be a smart energy city. 
As laid out in its Energy Strategy 2010-2020 report, the city 
aims to deliver 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 
2020. The plan also set a target to reduce carbon emissions 
by 26% by 2020 compared to 2025. The city has already 
reached its emissions target 4 years ahead of plan. 

The city-owned energy company, Robin Hood Energy, was 
established to deliver low cost energy to city households and 
businesses and is now also looking at furthering the city’s 
use of clean energy. Robin Hood Energy also provides white-
labelled energy company services to other cities, including 
the Leeds region and Liverpool.

Located in the new Trent Basin development, Project SCENe 
is a sustainable community energy project supported by 
Innovate UK funding and the Energy Research Accelerator. 
The project brings together companies involved in the 
energy supply chain and academics to work with around 
120 homes to deliver new models for community energy 
schemes. The project is also deploying a 2 MW Tesla battery 
in what is expected to be Europe’s largest community 
battery installation.

Nottingham Energy Partnership (NEP) has also delivered a 
solar battery storage project, Sungain Battery Bank, which 
allows 35 private households with rooftop solar to utilise 30% 
more of their generated energy. An extensive district heating 
system, the 100% council-owned Enviroenergy provides 
heating to 4,500 domestic and 150 commercial clients via 
high pressure steam from a waste incineration plan. 

The city council’s Energy Projects Service is delivering a multi-
million-pound programme of projects across Nottingham 
including commercial battery storage, rooftop, canopy 
and ground mounted solar PV, innovative fuel cells, boiler 
replacements, and LED lighting. A low energy street lighting 
replacement plan with integrated 4G controls is currently 
being rolled-out. This project includes the replacement of 
approximately 35,000 street lights (most of which has been 
completed) and the maintenance of approximately 42,000 
units over a 25-year period. 

Transport innovation is another focus for the city and has 
been closely linked to Nottingham’s energy and carbon 
reduction strategy. A smart ticketing system, Robin Hood 
Network, is in operation for the public transport network. 
The network also has an integrated system that displays real-
time information for bus and tram arrivals and alternative 
cycling routes on over 1,500 screens across the region and 
through the Robin Hood travel app. Over 8 million public 
transport journeys are now made via the Robin Hood 
platform each year.

Nottingham received £5 million of funding from the 
EU’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme 
as a lighthouse city for the Remourban project to tackle 
sustainability issues concerning transport, energy, and ICT. 
Launched in 2015, the Remourban project is a collaboration 
between Nottingham City Council, Nottingham Trent 
University, Nottingham City Homes, and NEP in addition  
to two SMEs, INFOHUB and SASIE. 

Transport options also include an hourly EV rental scheme 
(City Car Club Nottingham, run by Enterprise) and a fleet of 
38 electric buses, including 13 new BYD electric buses with 
smart charging. A new option under development is a last-
mile delivery hub managed by WEGO, in which eight EVs 
will deliver on behalf of hauliers to minimise the number of 
trucks entering the city.

The University of Nottingham has initiated a smart campus 
project that is also acting as a testbed for city innovation.  
For example, it has been analysing mobility patterns between 
campus sites and the insights are now being applied to the 
city bike scheme. The campus is also home to eight Living 
Lab homes that are trialling new ways to build affordable  
and environmentally friendly homes.

The city has also been working on the development of 
its open data strategy. There are two platforms, the city 
council’s own open data site and Nottingham Insight – the 
former provides datasets from the council whilst the latter 
includes a wide range of data, information and analysis from 
the public sector across Nottinghamshire.

In 2012, Peterborough was awarded £3 million by Innovate 
UK under its Future Cities Demonstrator competition. The 
resulting programme, Peterborough DNA, has been jointly led 
by the city council and its economic development company, 
Opportunity Peterborough. In 2016, Peterborough began 
scaling up the projects delivered as part of Peterborough 
DNA through the establishment of the Future Peterborough 
program. This transition was fostered by Peterborough’s 
Smart City Leadership Program, which works to drive forward 
and monitor smart city progress. Future Peterborough 
focuses on four key strands of activity: intelligence, people, 
smart leadership, and circular economy principles.

Digital technologies and innovation programmes are viewed 
as key elements in an integrated approach to addressing 
Peterborough’s challenges, and the city’s aim to establish 
itself as the UK’s Environment Capital. 

In April, 2017 the city council adopted a new Environment 
Action Plan for the city. As well as a plan for council-specific 
policies and targets for the city council, there is also a 
citywide plan developed with stakeholder organisations 
across the city. These plans, broken down into 10 areas and 
including interim targets to 2020 and goals for 2050, provide 
a vision for how the Environment Capital will be delivered.

4.2.7.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

One of the most successful projects to come out of  
the Peterborough DNA pilots is Share Peterborough,  
an online, resource-sharing platform for businesses 
and other organisations in the city. Members can use 
the platform to share any available resources including 
equipment, skills, spaces, and services. The platform now 
has over 100 members ranging from global corporations  
to local businesses and charities. Shared Peterborough 
started as a pilot in a small business district and has  
grown into a broader strategy for the Circular City that 
emphasises collaboration and sustainability through 
maximising resources.

The Digital Peterborough project is transitioning 
Peterborough into a Gigabit city by developing a citywide 
fibre Internet infrastructure. The project now connects 
107 public sector sites with a 90 km (and growing) core 
fibre network, and over 200 businesses are taking Gigabit 
Internet services. The Peterborough City Council will soon  
be connecting 220 new sites to the network made up of 
CCTV cameras, Wi-Fi connections, and a network of traffic 
system locations. 

An example of digital innovation in the city is the IoT-based 
Sustainable Drainage project. Peterborough’s geographic 
location and changing climate patterns make it increasingly 
susceptible to surface flooding. The city has implemented 
river level and rainfall sensors across the city to enable better 
management of flood risk. The sensor network enables 
experts to intelligently understand and react appropriately 
when rising river levels may result in surface water flooding 
and to plan effective interventions much more quickly.

Smart Cambridge has used initial funding from the Cambridge City Deal to establish 
a range of smart city innovation projects and a platform for further development 
in the Greater Cambridge area and beyond. The combination of local authority and 
university initiatives provides a strong basis for future exploitation of the platform 
to improve city services. With further funding now available for projects to address 
transport, housing, energy, and health improvements, Cambridge is well positioned 
to develop larger and more extensive projects in future.

4.2.8.1 Strategy

The Greater Cambridge Partnership is the local delivery body 
for the Cambridge City Deal, which is one of the largest city 
deal programmes in the UK. Greater Cambridge Partnership’s 
goal is to bring powers and investment, worth up to £1 
billion over 15 years, to vital improvements in infrastructure. 
Partners include Cambridgeshire County Council, Cambridge 
City Council, South Cambridgeshire District Council, 
University of Cambridge, and Greater Cambridge Greater 
Peterborough Local Enterprise Partnership. 

Greater Cambridge Partnership provided an initial investment 
of £300,000 in the Smart Cambridge programme, which was 
established in August 2015, to develop smart city initiatives 
in the region. A programme board and advisory group 
set up under the Greater Cambridge Partnership provides 
governance and guidance for the work of Smart Cambridge.

A key focus for that initial phase was the establishment  
of a common management platform for IoT-based 
innovation projects.

Additional funding has now been made available from 
the city deal to enable Smart Cambridge to support 
projects using data and digital technologies to address 
challenges in four key areas:

•  Transport: Making travel easier, reducing  
congestion, and exploring intelligent mobility

•  Environment: Managing our water, energy,  
air quality, and waste

•  Healthcare: Catering for an aging population  
and providing public health

•  Smart living: Improving the quality of life  
for communities in and around the city

4.2.8.2 Key Initiatives and Projects

Working closely with the University of Cambridge, Smart 
Cambridge has established the Smart Cambridge intelligent 
City Platform (iCP) to provide a common platform for 
a variety of IoT-based projects. The partners have also 
established a citywide LoRa low power network for 
demonstration IoT projects. Open APIs will soon be added  
to the network to enable a wider range of organisations  
to access and use the network for projects. The network  
is managed by the University of Cambridge. 

One of the most extensive of the initial projects on the 
network is an air quality monitoring system for the city. 
Twenty air quality sensors were added to the network to 
provide more granular information on city pollution levels. 
Work is now being done with the university to explore how 
this project might be extended to a wider range of sensors. 
Other initial projects include traffic monitoring sensors  
and the provision of real-time bus and train information. 

Smart Cambridge publishes data through a countywide 
partnership, Cambridge Insight. Cambridge Insight  
provides an open data platform for sharing data and 
a research knowledge base for the Cambridgeshire 
area. The links with the University of Cambridge are 
particularly important for expanding the use of data for 
city improvement. The university is providing computing, 
networking, and analytic resources, and is leading the  
way in the investigation of the use of machine learning  
and predictive analytics on city data. 

Improving transport in the region and reducing city 
congestion are important focus areas for Smart Cambridge.  
In early 2018, Cambridge intends to release its own mobile 
app that will provide information and support for users of 
local transport services. Other projects being considered 
include the development of a unified ticketing scheme,  
the potential role of AVs in Cambridge, and the feasibility  
of new rapid transit solutions (and how these might integrate 
with emerging technologies like AVs). Cambridge is building  
a super cycleway network, expanding bus services and Park  
& Ride sites. It is also aiming to improve the management  
and use of on-street and workplace parking through  
smart technologies.

The Connecting Cambridgeshire programme, in conjunction 
with commercial providers, aims to improve Cambridgeshire’s 
digital infrastructure with better broadband, free public 
Wi-Fi, and wider mobile coverage. In January 2016, the 
programme completed the first phase of its superfast fibre 
broadband rollout, meaning more than 300,000 households 
and businesses now have access to fibre-based broadband. 
Combined with commercial provision, the fibre rollout has 
now reached 95% of homes and businesses across the 
county. Connecting Cambridgeshire has also assisted  
almost 2,000 business in becoming connected, and has 
provided free public Wi-Fi in more than 120 public buildings 
and open spaces.

Oxford is one of the UK’s fastest growing cities. It is  
home to over 5,000 businesses and 130,000 jobs, and  
is internationally renowned for its academic excellence.  
The city has a high concentration of multi-million-pound 
science and technology facilities, supporting world-
class research in fields such as advanced engineering, 
manufacturing and life sciences.

The Smart Oxford initiative is supported by the Oxford 
Strategic Partnership (OSP), a group of collaborating 
organisations from across the public sector, academia, 
business and voluntary and community organisations. 
Day-to-day coordination and planning of the Smart Oxford 
programme is carried out by members of the Smart 
Oxford project board, and individuals drawn from local 
organisations. The programme is focusing on issues  
around transport, health, and the environment.

The governance structure for Smart Oxford has been 
purposely arranged to not be led by a single entity, which 
has helped build a culture of trust and collaboration among 
partners. This approach is also reflected in the focus on 
developing Oxford as a Shared City that is inclusive of all 
communities. Smart Oxford is building on the strengths  
of the city and that community to compete for national  
and European funding for innovation projects. Oxford  
was one of nine finalists for the 2016 European Capital  
of Innovation award. 

4.2.9.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Several significant transport innovation programs  
are being deployed in Oxford and the surrounding 
county, including: 

•  CASPAR, supported by the Department of Transport, 
is a project focused on providing real-time information 
regarding the availability of blue badge parking spaces. 
The project involves the installation of sensors and camera 
monitoring technology within Oxford and Witney that 
will provide real-time car parking and EV charge point 
availability data. The information will be integrated  
with Oxfordshire CC’s Urban Traffic Management  
Control System. 

•  Oxfordshire CC is participating in the OneTRANSPORT 
project and has helped to create a OneM2M-based 
Open Ecosystem for Nationwide Transport Integration. 
The project aims to make transport more user friendly 
and accessible across local authorities and bringing all 
transport related data to one platform. 

•  In July a major connected and autonomous vehicles  
(CAV) project; DRIVEN was launched in Oxford, this is  
a collaboration led by Oxbotica and a range of partners  
to deliver the first UK fleet of multi provider CAV’s.

•  People in Autonomous Vehicles in Urban Environments 
(PAVE) is an Oxfordshire based consortium made up of 
RACE, Siemens, Amey, Oxbotica and Westbourne to 
understand what people think about driverless cars, using 
the Culham Science Centre in Oxford as a test location. 
This is the first study of its kind in the UK to assess public 
perception around driverless cars. 

•  Oxford’s Go Ultra Low project is a joint city and county 
council project to test the best solutions for on-street 
charging in Oxford’s terraced streets, with the initial aim 
of deploying 100 charge points across the city. 

Smart Oxford is closely connected to MobOx a Community 
Interest Company, with links to Oxford University and 
Brookes University a range of entrepreneurs and Oxfordshire 
CC. It was established to support Oxford as a living lab for 
mobility and support R&D and business modelling in Oxford. 
A current focus is developing a mobility-as-a-service solution 
with a broad network of partners in Oxford. 

The Oxford Flood Network is a citizen-based initiative to 
detect floods using an IoT network of sensors to monitor 
water levels in local rivers and streams. The project has been 
supported by Nominet UK, which has been working closely 
with Smart Oxford on the deployment of IoT pilots. Over  
the next year, the project aims to ramp up to 100 sensors  
to provide a detailed view of the waterways of Oxford.

An example of increasingly close collaboration between the 
city and its universities is a project between Oxford Robotics 
Institute and Oxford City Council to trialling city mapping 
technology. Sensors are being attached to a council street 
cleaner in the city centre to create 3D maps that can be  
used to trial the development of autonomous vehicles.  
The data can also be used to help the council better  
manage city operations, from road maintenance, to air 
quality, to waste management.

Oxfordshire Open Data is an open data platform jointly 
managed by the city and county councils. It provides a 
platform for the public, researchers and developers to 
access, analyse and share information about the Oxfordshire. 
The aim is to develop the platform as an open resource 
to support service innovation and to reduce the cost of 
information sharing across local agencies.

Better Broadband for Oxfordshire is targeting superfast 
broadband access to at least 71,000 homes and businesses, 
meaning at least 95 per cent of all premises in Oxford 
will have superfast broadband access by the end of 2017. 
Oxford provides free wireless provision in public buildings 
and a wireless concession in public spaces is expected to be 
procured in 2017.

Aberdeen has embarked on a major reappraisal of the city council’s operational 
strategy with the aim of creating a new framework for improving city operations 
and providing a platform for future innovation with a clear focus on the city’s 
priorities. Aberdeen’s approach will be watched closely by other cities as it looks 
to take a lead in developing the policy innovations needed to turn smart city 
visions into reality. The city has already undertaken a range of innovative energy 
and transport projects and has begun a smart street lighting pilot. The city is also 
developing plans for the evolution of its communication infrastructure.

4.2.10.2 Strategy

Aberdeen is Scotland’s third-largest city and a leading 
business hub in the UK. Whilst most economic activity  
in the city has historically been in primary industries such  
as oil & gas, Aberdeen is quickly moving to diversify 
its economy. As employment in the fossil fuel sector 
is declining, renewable energy development, clean 
transportation technologies, and digital infrastructure 
expansion are key areas primed for growth. As a major 
port city, with the harbour an integral part of the city 
environment, the operations of the port and its broader 
impact on the development of the city are important 
elements in the city’s overall strategy.

Aberdeen City Council and community planning partners 
have agreed to a 10-year programme under the Local 
Outcome Improvement Plan 2016 to ensure Aberdeen  
is “A place where all people can prosper.” 

The 10-year plan aims to break the cycle of deprivation 
which exists for some communities in Aberdeen to 
create a cycle of prosperity through the delivery of 
four priorities for partnership working: 

•  A prosperous Aberdeen

•  A recognition that children are our future 

•  That people are resilient, included,  
and supported when needed

•  The empowerment of resilient  
and sustainable communities

A fifth priority of Creating a Digital Place cuts across all 
priority areas as a key enabler of innovative and integrated 
future public services. 

In August 2017, the city council approved a new framework 
referred to as the Target Operating Model, which will 
provide the strategic vision and governance models for  
the transformation of council services over the coming year. 
The new model provides a cross-sector, design-focused 
perspective on the city’s strategic priorities. The Target 
Operating Model will look at future smart city developments 
as a core part of the design response to these priority neds. 
It also paves the way for establishing new partnerships with 
the private sector partners, citizens and community interests 
to deliver the necessary platforms, and solutions based on  
a common understanding of behaviours and values as well 
as technology requirements.

Aberdeen’s Sustainable Energy Action Plan (Powering 
Aberdeen) targets a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases by 
2030 (compared to 2005 baseline), as well as a renewable 
energy target to generate the equivalent of 100% of 
gross annual electricity consumption and 11% of heat 
consumption by 2020. 

As part of the city’s effort to promote citizen engagement 
and social inclusion, Aberdeen has an extensive citizens 
panel (Aberdeen Voice) covering a representative sample of 
all demographics who participate in both digital and real-
world engagement to help the Council and partners identify 
the issues and inform the solutions to city challenges.

4.2.10.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Renewable energy and energy efficiency are major areas 
of focus for Aberdeen. Launched in 2001, The Aberdeen 
Renewable Energy Group is a public-private partnership (P3) 
with over 160 members that seeks to initiate and deliver 
large renewable projects. The city has a number of initiatives 
underway, including offshore wind farms, local onshore 
wind applications, solar installations on public buildings (over 
90 solar PV systems installed), and the city’s first community 
renewables project called Donside Hydro. The city is building 
a European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre off the coast 
of Aberdeen to accelerate the development of offshore wind 
power in Scotland, and is also in the process of building an 
Energy from Waste facility.

The Aberdeen Hydrogen Bus Project is a £20 million 
partnership with industry and public sector players. 
Aberdeen currently has the largest hydrogen bus fleet in the 
UK, with 10 hydrogen-powered buses operating on locally 
generated renewable hydrogen from two refuelling stations. 
Another clean transportation initiative is the Co-wheels 
Car Club – a carsharing programme in Aberdeen with over 
1,000 members and roughly 40 vehicles, including a variety 
of hybrids and EVs. 

In terms of digital infrastructure, Aberdeen is developing a 
new ICT data centre and a citywide smart Wi-Fi network to 
make broadband widely available to its residents. Free Wi-Fi 
is now available to the public in 30 Aberdeen City Council 
buildings. A citywide low power network is currently under 
deployment and the Aberdeen City Region Deal area has 
also been selected as one of six pilot areas for the roll out of 
DCMS full-fibre voucher assistance for businesses. Delivery 
of Europe’s first large-scale, multi-operator, small-cell mobile 
network has been completed and is under testing prior to 
a public launch during September. Aberdeen is also one of 
four Scottish cities selected to pilot the SCA Intelligent Street 
Lighting programme, supported by a £2.8 million grant from 
the ERDF.

The Council is in the process of creating a new citywide 
open data portal to be operational by the end of 2017.  
The hope is that, by working with partners, this will also 
enable a city information exchange across the public and 
private sector to stimulate innovation in commercial and 
public sector solutions. 

Aberdeen is part of a consortium delivering the Civitas 
PORTIS project. This 4 year, Horizon 2020 project that will 
test innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions 
in five European port cities (alongside Antwerp, Trieste, 
Klaipeda, and Constanta). Ningbo, in China, is also involved 
as a follower city. The project aims to show that sustainable 
urban mobility can increase functional and social cohesion 
between city centres and ports, whilst improving the 
economy and attractiveness of urban environments.

4.2.11.2 Strategy

Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is one of the fastest 
growing cities in the UK. It is striving to be the most 
connected, creative and inclusive entrepreneurial city in 
Europe. Edinburgh has made several areas of investment a 
strategic priority, including infrastructure, innovation hubs, 
housing, culture and tourism, and cross-cutting programmes 
such as inclusive growth and skills, and digital and low 
carbon technologies. 

Several city-led initiatives are underway. Edinburgh Council’s 
Transport 2030 Vision is a strategy to make the city’s 
transportation system one of the greenest, healthiest, 
and most accessible in Northern Europe. Additionally, the 
2050 Edinburgh City Vision serves as a long-term strategy 
for future life in the city. The project opened submissions 
from the public to create a citywide conversation about 
the long-term future of Edinburgh – focusing on people, 
the environment, and the economy. Thus far, the city has 
received over 5,700 idea submissions and will be holding 
events and workshops to further develop the vision before  
it is finalised. 

In addition, Edinburgh is working with Smart Cities Scotland, 
one of the Scottish Cities Alliance (SCA) programme 
workstreams, to coordinate its urban innovation programme 
with Scotland’s other six cities and to collaborate on several 
smart city projects. 

4.2.11.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Edinburgh is developing a wide variety of projects through 
the Smart Cities Scotland workstream. In the city operations 
sector, the city is working collaboratively with Perth, 
Dundee, Glasgow, and Stirling to deliver smart waste 
technologies. Smart bins are being deployed to enable 
improved waste management services, increase efficiency 
in garbage collection, and enhance recycling techniques. 
Intelligent lighting pilots and CCTV cameras are also being 
deployed. In the transport sector, the Edinburgh Bustracker 
API is a web service that delivers real-time bus information 
for the Edinburgh area. The API delivers information to users 
on routes, destinations, bus stops, and service disruptions. 

Other measures outlined in Edinburgh’s Transport 
2030 Vision include:

•  Environmentally friendly: Work towards an emissions-
free public transport fleet by supporting initiatives for 
electric and hybrid vehicles, parking permit changes based 
on vehicle emissions, green procurement for council fleet 
vehicles, and air quality improvements in partnership with 
the freight industry.

•  Healthy: Increase investment in cycling infrastructure, 
improve conditions for pedestrians, promote active and 
smart travel through travel planning programmes, low 
emission zones, active traffic management to mitigate 
high pollution areas. 

•  Accessible: Expansion of Park and Ride programme, 
increased public transport capacity including potential 
expansion of tram network, high speed rail, and 
engagement with freight sector to increase flow  
of goods and services.

The Transport 2030 Vision also includes measures to make 
Edinburgh’s transport system smarter and safer through 
measures such as intelligent traffic control systems, 
integrated ticketing, and greater use of CCTV and lighting.

Alongside Digital Scotland, the Scottish government has 
also deployed several pilot projects in Edinburgh through 
the Demonstrating Digital programme (over £400,000 
funding to date). These pilots include the support of housing 
associations to develop affordable broadband services 
for digitally excluded tenants, and telehealth support for 
the University of Edinburgh to demonstrate point-to-
point wireless links utilising free space optics and 24 GHz 
microwave technology. 

The Edinburgh Living Lab is a citywide collaboration  
founded by the City of Edinburgh and the University of 
Edinburgh. The goal of the Living Lab is to explore new 
approaches to innovation, sustainable development, and 
policy making through data-driven analysis and participatory 
research (small-scale experiments with citizen end users).  
It is interdisciplinary, though mobility and energy are major 
focuses of the program. Within the mobility space, the Living 
Lab has conducted an electric taxi feasibility study, and 
analysed walking and cycling data to promote active travel. 
Energy management in public sector buildings and energy 
data access for all are significant initiatives within the Lab’s 
energy division.

In terms of civic engagement, EdinburghApps is an annual 
challenge as part of the City Council’s civic challenge 
programme. Launched in 2013, it was the first event 
of its kind in the UK – aiming to provide creative and 
customer-driven solutions to city challenges. One of the 
finalist apps from 2016 was an app called #agameofwalks, 
which encourages residents to travel by foot, bike, or 
public transport through gamification. Addiction Recovery 
Companion (ARC), an app to support those in early recovery 
from drug or alcohol addiction. Co-designed by a new 
company working with the council service and its clients, 
the app has attracted attention from health and local 
government bodies across the UK.

Newcastle University has been a driving force behind Newcastle’s smart city 
innovation programmes. Working with Newcastle City Council and other partners,  
it is coordinating and facilitating a portfolio of innovations projects that span 
digitalization of the council, innovation in city services, and smart infrastructure. 
Newcastle was a pathfinder for city deals and the devolution of power to cities.  
It was also one of the leaders in the developing a sustainable city programme.  
The city is now pressing forward again with a refreshed vision and unique partnership 
model to accelerate the adoption of smart, clean, and digital technologies.

4.2.12.1 Strategy

A city containing more than 380,000 citizens and merging 
with areas encompassing over 1 million people, Newcastle 
faces numerous social and economic challenges, but it is 
also the fastest growing region outside London for digital 
and technology employment with 30,000 employed in the 
sector. Newcastle’s smart city initiatives focus on identifying 
solutions for its major challenges and boosting its aim to be 
a leading city for science and digital technology. 

Newcastle University and Newcastle City Council are 
together developing Science Central, a £350 million  
flagship project bringing together academia, the public 
sector, communities, business, and industry to create 
a global centre for urban innovation. Science Central 
is providing a space for many of Newcastle’s smart city 
initiatives to be tested and developed. Newcastle City 
Council published its Digital Technology Plan in 2017.

Newcastle City Futures (NCF) is also now at the forefront 
of progressing smart and socially inclusive city initiatives 
across the city. Newcastle University led the establishment 
of NCF in 2014 as a collaborative platform to bring together 
Research and Development potential with long term policy 
trends and business needs in the city. NCF is part of a 
broader network of special purpose vehicles including the 
city council’s City Futures Development Group, the Science 
City Partnership Board, and Newcastle 2020, which bring 
researchers, businesses and municipal government together 
to address future challenges of the city. 

In May 2016, NCF further scaled up its activities to become 
one of five Urban Living Partnership (ULP) pilots funded 
with £1.2 million from Research Councils UK and Innovate 
UK. NCF now comprises over 160 partners covering public, 
private, and third-party sectors in the city, prioritizing 
themes for Newcastle to be a Digital City; an Age-Friendly 
City; a Scientific City; and a Cultural City. Over 50 cross-
sectoral, multi partnered innovation projects are now being 
developed, brokered by the university, by facilitating pilots 
and proof of concept approaches.

4.2.12.2 Key Initiatives and Projects

Over the past 18 months, Newcastle has invested 
significantly in new centres within the Science Central 
campus, including the government-funded £40million 
National Innovation Centre for Ageing Science, the  
£30 million National Innovation Centre for Smart Data  
Institute, and a £10 million National Centre for Energy 
Systems Integration. 

Adjacent to the centres, Newcastle University has opened  
its Urban Sciences Building, a £60m centre for digital,  
data and visualisation, at the heart of the city’s new 
Innovation District, Science Central. A new £20 million 
Newcastle Laboratory will be also completed in 2018. 
The USB is the home for the Digital Institute, the Cloud 
Computing CDT, Open Lab, and the Urban Observatory  
and aims to accelerate innovation with businesses in  
and beyond the region. 

More than £8m in Research Council grants has also been 
awarded to Open Lab to create a Digital Civics programme 
involving 60 PhD digital and public service students and a 
Digital Economy Research Centre to support project delivery 
across the city. More widely across the city, a £1 billion 
investment strategy for the Metro and £200 million for 
investment in the airport have also been announced. 

Newcastle University’s Smart City project utilizes different 
Science Central labs to support 4 major projects, including 
a Smart Energy Network, Local Energy Supply, Green 
Flood Management, and Integrated Transport. These labs 
have capabilities for gathering and processing data from 
digital sensors and creating models for determining the 
impact of different technologies, which has enabled more 
efficient use of grid assets, outage detection, development 
of local microgrids, big data applications, flood reduction, 
cooperation between businesses, electric vehicle support, 
transportation planning, and tracking cycling benefits. 

The NCF innovation projects include: Future Homes,  
Metro Futures, and Future High Street:

•  The Future Homes project aims to develop new digitally-
enabled housing that show how one home can combine 
innovations in flexible living, materials, digital technology, 
and zero-to-low energy systems for support throughout 
the lifecourse. In December 2016, the Homes and 
Community Agency awarded the Future Homes project 
with £1.12 million to construct four demonstrator units  
in Newcastle. 

•  The Metro Futures project created a digital engagement 
platform that attracted 3000 citizen participants shaping 
the design of their city’s new metro cars for accessibility 
and mobility to inform a bid by Nexus to the Department 
for Transport in February 2017.

•  Future High Street aims to redesign Newcastle’s 
city centre by deploying digital retailing and green 
infrastructure that links customers to businesses,  
and creates a more vibrant and fun environment. 

Newcastle and Gateshead have together been awarded The 
Great Exhibition of the North 2018 by the UK government. 
The event will span 77 days in the summer, and digital and 
creativity will be a principal theme for new installations to be 
showcased across the city.

4.3.1.2 Strategy

Belfast City Council has been working with the city’s 
partners and the Future Cities Catapult to develop a Smart 
Belfast framework that will lay the basis for its smart city 
programme. The aim is to build on the city’s strengths in 
the digital sector to develop additional collaboration and 
innovation between local businesses, universities, and the 
public sector.

The Smart Belfast framework aims to develop  
the city’s capabilities in four areas:

•  A shared understanding of the city’s challenges: 
Working with partners to find new ways to collaborate 
and address problems.

•  Engagement with the innovation community:  
Co-opting the local SME sector and universities to tackle 
challenges together.

•  Building city data assets: Working with partners to 
understand how data can be better generated, managed, 
and accessed to develop new products and services.

•  Developing robust delivery mechanisms: Helping  
city partners find new ways to attract investment and  
to support the development, testing, and rapid scaling  
of successful innovations.

4.3.1.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Belfast has already supported several projects to improve 
the gathering and use of data to improve city services and 
capabilities. For example, it ran a successful Small Business 
Research Initiative (SBRI) competition that identified 
machine-learning and other data analytics solutions to assist 
Land and Property Services to find sources of non-domestic 
rates income for the region.

Belfast has worked with the Futures Cities Catapult to 
develop a web-based tool to identify the capacity of major 
infrastructure systems across the city. Over time, this is likely 
to include capacity details for energy, water, and digital 
infrastructure. The city is also looking to develop a city 
dashboard to start monitoring various aspects of the city, 
including outcomes for health, economy, or sustainable 
development. The city has also invested in its infrastructure, 
and currently has 100 public buildings with public Wi-Fi and 
is deploying Wi-Fi to outdoor areas in the city centre.

The Smart Belfast Collaborative Challenge with Invest NI 
will be launched in late September 2017. This will provide 
initial funding for up to eight networks seeking to explore 
innovation in the areas of urban transport, visitor experience, 
the circular economy, active living, and the management of 
the public estate. More substantial funding may be available 
for proposals that show significant potential.

Belfast has been a pioneer in telemedicine and health 
technologies. The European Centre for Connected Health 
(ECCH) – now known as Centre for Connected Health and 
Social Care – was established in 2008. The Centre promotes 
improvements in patient care using new technologies, and 
fast-tracks new products and innovation in the Health and 
Social Care system in Northern Ireland.

4.3.2.1  Summary 

Sheffield is making gradual progress in the development of its smart city vision. 
An initial consultation on the Sheffield Plan: City-Wide Options for Growth to 2034 
suggested digital and technical innovations needed to support a smart city vision. 
The city has made strides in developing this plan further and implementing pilot 
city projects with a digital focus. There continues to be opportunity for the city 
to make stronger links between its broader strategy and the potential for smart 
city innovations, as is being explored in the Smart City Lab. Clearer leadership and 
coordination across Sheffield’s smart city activities is still needed to strengthen its 
smart city brand.

4.3.2.2 Strategy

A city with a long history as an industrial centre, Sheffield 
has a population of over 560,000 today. The Sheffield  
City Council launched an initiative in late 2015 to develop  
a plan for the city that looks forward 15-20 years until  
2034. It targets a growing population and the need for 
improved transport, housing, and sustainable energy.  
Digital connectivity is identified as a key enabler, along  
with education and training to develop the workforce.  
A Consultation Report is expected to be available in autumn 
2017 to launch consultation on the policies and proposals 
contained in the draft Sheffield Plan. The target is to have  
an action plan adopted in 2019.

The Sheffield Plan will likely be informed by the city’s 
sustainability plan. In 2016, the Sheffield Green Commission 
issued its final report on Sheffield’s Green Commitment, 
summarising a 12-month consultation on how the city 
can move towards becoming more sustainable. The 
report is centred around four themes: Connected City, 
Transformative Energy, European Green City, and Learning 
City. In March 2017, the Sheffield City Council published  
a five-point sustainability plan, Growing Sustainably:  
A Bold Plan for a Sustainable Sheffield, in response to  
the Green Commission’s final report. The city council is  
now undertaking a comprehensive gap analysis to develop 
an action plan to carry forward its sustainability strategy.

4.3.2.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

The Sheffield Smart Lab is a project run by city council and 
service partners, Ferrovial and Amey, to establish Sheffield  
as a centre for urban innovation by identifying, developing, 
and piloting new solutions to city challenges. The programme 
also aims to encourage and support entrepreneurs in 
Sheffield and raise the city profile as an ideal test bed for 
developing smart solutions to tough city issues. The lab’s 
two initial challenges focused on rejuvenating and making 
the city centre more dynamic and supporting independent 
living for housebound citizens. Nine winning solutions were 
selected from more than 50 proposals received from 10 
different countries. The startups had the opportunity to 
participate in an incubation and acceleration programme 
to develop and test their ideas and business models in an 
innovation centre supported by the University of Sheffield 
and Sheffield Hallam University. 

Sheffield is also making progress in establishing an open 
data platform, which currently hosts around 100 city 
datasets. The city has also hosted several events to promote 
the creative use of data to improve service delivery in the 
city. The Air Quality+ initiative, developed in partnership 
with the Better With Data Society (a local open data 
community), aims to engage the community in creating 
a data-driven ambition and datasets for air quality in 
Sheffield. The resulting Sheffield AirMap provides real-time 
information within a defined Air Quality Management area, 
increases awareness, and promotes activities that contribute 
to better air quality and environmental efficiency.

4.3.3.2 Strategy

With a population of approximately 233,000 inhabitants at 
the core, Reading is considered one of the leading digital 
economies of the UK, situated as it is in the heart of the 
UK’s technology sector along the M4 corridor.

The Reading 2050 Vision will be launched in October 2017. 
The document will outline a plan to make Reading a smart 
and sustainable city by 2050: “a city where low carbon 
living is the norm, and the built environment, technology, 
and innovation have combined to create a dynamic, smart, 
and sustainable city with a high quality of life and equal 
opportunities for all.” This is a private, sector-led initiative 
by Reading UK, the economic development and marketing 
company for the town with lead partners Barton Wilmore, 
an independent national planning and design company 
and the University of Reading, with support from Reading 
Borough Council. The Reading 2050 has already been 
written into the draft consultation Reading Local Plan.

The Reading 2050 Vision is based on a 3-year exercise that 
involved engagement with 21,000 members of the local 
community and some 350 local business representatives,  
as well as 15 events. More than 50 ideas have been 
taken from the workshops to provide the basis for further 
discussion and action, and a set of vision statements have 
been established to communicate how Reading will evolve  
in the future and to measure progress.

The vision embodies three interrelated themes  
to help focus and manage future work streams: 

•  Reading: A City of Green technology

•  Reading: A City of Culture and Diversity

•  Reading: A City of Rivers and Parks

In addition to the Reading 2050 Vision, a climate action 
plan for Reading for 2013-2020 has been outlined by the 
Reading Climate Change Partnership – a group including 
the council, universities, NHS, and local businesses and 
community organisations. This sets targets for a range of 
environmental programmes, including energy consumption, 
waste reduction, and water management.

4.3.3.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Thames Valley Berkshire LEP has funded a Smart City 
Network involving Reading, Bracknell, and Newbury.  
Led by Reading Borough Council, it plans to develop 
new capital-based energy and mobility projects. This will 
complement other local smart energy projects, including  
the new hydro scheme at Caversham Weir. Led by Scottish 
and Southern Energy Power Distribution in partnership  
with University of Reading, the continuing Thames Valley 
Vision low carbon project is trialling smart grid solutions, 
smart meters, in-home displays, and renewable energy 
generation technologies.

The University of Reading’s School of Built Environment  
has developed a virtual and a 3D physical model of Reading, 
with further plans to develop an urban room, celebrating 
the past, present, and future of Reading. In partnership with 
a range of research partners, the university is developing 
further funding bids for projects that build on the Reading 
2050 work, based on, for example, modelling urban 
metabolism and designing tools for improved planning and 
decision support for socio-environmental change to 2050.

Transport is another focus area. The city transport strategy 
includes the deployment of the Reading smart transport 
card, a comprehensive cycle network; and a rapid transit 
system to connect the city from east to west and from  
north to south, relieving congestion in the town centre.  
As parallel with these developments, the council has also 
been proactive in making transport network data available 
to developers.

Reading’s Real-Time Open Data Information System provides 
access to an extensive range of data from the regional travel 
network. API are provided to enable developers to use the 
data for the development of new services and applications. 

In January 2017, Reading Buses, the group managing the 
city’s public bus service, launched its contactless pay system 
and mobile ticketing and bus information app. Buses now 
accept contactless bank card payments and direct debits for 
smart card holders. The company has also deployed what 
is claimed to be the world’s first compressed natural gas 
operated bus coming from a certified carbon neutral bio-
methane source.

The city is promoting business incubation units called Ideas 
Factories, as well as the use of Reading University’s city 
centre campus to exhibit and test innovative ideas and 
approaches. Other planned projects include retrofitting 
existing buildings and the development of iconic architecture 
to provide some of the greenest accommodation possible  
for incoming businesses. To support further innovation in 
the city, the council and the University of Reading joined 
forces to launch a science park to attract new digital 
business to the region and better support local startups.

4.3.4.2 Strategy

Liverpool is a city of 485,000 people and sits at the heart of 
region of 1.7 million people and an economy worth almost 
£30 billion. After a long period of population decline, the 
city’s population is once again growing. Liverpool’s 2016 
City Region Growth Strategy focuses on key sectors such 
as advanced manufacturing, digital services, financial and 
professional services, health and life sciences, low carbon 
energy, maritime and logistics, and the visitor economy.  
The strategy aims to create an additional 100,000 jobs in  
the Liverpool City Region by 2040.

Liverpool has developed several smart city initiatives without 
establishing a formal overarching programme or leadership 
board. The city has appointed a mayoral lead for smart 
cities in James Noakes, who is also an elected member. 
Further developments at the strategic level are expected in 
the near future to formalise recent consultations. It is also 
undertaking a benchmarking exercise to help direct and 
focus its future smart city initiatives. 

Initial smart city projects have focused on the city’s  
economic growth areas and also on priority service issues 
such as the provision of social care. Another area of focus 
has been innovation in the energy sector. The city is looking 
to address issues associated with fuel poverty and also to 
reduce city emissions. It is also supporting the growing 
cleantech sector, boosted by the presence of the world-
leading Burbo Bank offshore wind farm in Liverpool Bay  
and the potential for tidal energy projects in the Mersey, 
which has one of the largest tidal ranges in the country.

The city is looking to improve its broadband and wireless 
communication infrastructure, including expanding its fibre 
infrastructure, improving Wi-Fi coverage, and deploying 
a low powered network to catalyse the take-up and 
development of IoT projects in the city. This is part of a 
broader ambition to make Liverpool a chosen destination for 
organisations looking to deploy urban innovation solutions. 

4.3.4.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

The city has initiated a range of smart energy programs 
including street lighting upgrades, building energy 
management and the CHP systems in public buildings.  
These have helped it to be ahead of its target to reduce 
emissions by 35% by 2020 on a 2012 baseline. 

Providing affordable energy for low income residents is 
a priority for Liverpool. Initiatives include the Merseyside 
collective switching scheme, Energy Projects Plus 
(environmental charity providing energy advice, training,  
and education), and the Health Through Warmth 
programme (help with heating and insulation for low 
income households) are all supported by the Liverpool City 
Council. The city has also developed its own local non-profit 
energy company called the Liverpool Energy Community 
Company (LECCY), a partnership with Nottingham’s Robin 
Hood Energy, which also includes a smart meter rollout. 

Liverpool is home to one of the most innovative offshore 
wind developments in the world. The Burbo Bank offshore 
wind farm (off Liverpool Bay) generates enough power for 
230,000 homes, using the world’s largest wind turbines.  
As of the end of 2016, Liverpool was home to over 1,200 
low carbon businesses employing over 26,000 people. 

The Liverpool-based design and technology company,  
Red Ninja, is working with the city on a trial programme  
for intelligent traffic light management. Life First Emergency 
Traffic Control (LiFE) uses artificial intelligence to analyse 
traffic and journey data to improve the response rate for 
emergency response vehicles through congested roads.  
The team has developed an application that can manipulate 
traffic in almost real-time through traffic light control. 
Ambulances are then able to reach emergency cases more 
quickly by integrating route-finder applications with city 
traffic management systems.

Red Ninja also worked with Merseytravel, the local public 
transport company, to conduct a public transport monitoring 
project. The project used smartphone data to analyse 
pedestrian travel patterns and the use of transit systems  
in order make improvements to public transport routes  
and scheduling. 

Health innovation is another major focus in Liverpool.  
The Innovation Hub at the renowned Alder Hey Children’s 
Hospital is a centre for advanced research in many areas. 
Liverpool City Region’s e-Health Cluster is also the only  
SME-led e-Health Cluster in the UK.

Supported by a £5 million award from the European Regional 
Development Fund (ERDF), a high tech sensor hub has 
been established in the city centre. The £15 million Sensor 
City facility, is a JV between the University of Liverpool and 
Liverpool John Moores University. It aims to make Liverpool  
a world-recognised centre for sensor technologies.

ambitious smart parking project shows there is an appetite to deploy innovative 
technology to meet city challenges. However, at present it lacks a cohesive and 
visible programme for smart city and digital innovation.

4.4.1.2 Strategy

Cardiff is the capital of and largest city in Wales, and 
the eleventh-largest city in the UK with around 346,000 
inhabitants. The city’s population is expanding rapidly  
and is expected to grow between 15% and 20% over  
the next decade.

In March 2017, the Welsh government announced a  
new £1.2 billion City Deal for Cardiff to unlock significant 
economic growth across the region. Over its lifetime, local 
partners expect the City Deal to create 25,000 new jobs 
and attract an additional £4 billion in private investment. 
The aims of the CCR City Deal are to “create jobs and 
boost economic prosperity by improving productivity, tackle 
unemployment, build on foundations of innovation, invest 
in physical and digital infrastructure, provide support for 
business, and ensure that any economic benefits generated 
as a result are felt across the region.” 

The City Deal includes the 10 local authorities of Blaenau 
Gwent, Bridgend, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil, 
Monmouthshire, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Torfaen, 
and the Vale of Glamorgan. Cardiff Capital Region 
is working with the UK government and the Welsh 
government to develop a joint implementation plan. 

The Cardiff Capital Region Transition Plan details key 
initiatives of the City Deal, including the establishment of a 
Regional Office to drive the delivery of the work programme, 
in anticipation of receiving proposals. The Regional 
Office will select the most promising proposals from the 
community based on a bespoke impact assessment model 
that emphasises economic benefits and impacts.

4.4.1.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

The CCR Regional cabinet has already earmarked £37.9 
million to support development of a new Compound 
Semiconductor Applications cluster located in South Wales. 
The funding comes from CCR’s City Deal’s Wider Investment 
Fund, and is the first investment announced since the 
signing of the City Deal. The project is expected to attract  
an additional £375 million from the private sector and create 
up to 2,000 high technology jobs and hundreds more in the 
wider supply chain. The high tech cluster is already gaining 
signification traction, with a recent slate of R&D awards and 
contract wins by businesses and academic institutions based 
in the area.

A successful smart city initiative, independent of the City 
Deal, is a smart parking project executed jointly by Cardiff 
City Council and Smart Parking Ltd. In February 2017,  
over 3,000 infrared vehicle detection sensors were installed 
in on-street and off-street locations throughout the city.  
The deployment included dynamic signage directing 
motorists to available parking, and a smartphone app 
offering real-time parking availability and guidance.  
Back office processing and analysis platform, SmartRep, 
provides real-time parking space occupancy on a live map. 
This project follows a successful pilot in 2015 that covered 
275 bays across the city.

4.4.2.2 Strategy

In January 2017, Exeter was named the fastest growing 
city in the UK. Its economic region is prospering and the 
local development framework outlines ambitious plans for 
growth. Currently, the population is 124,000, with a travel 
to work area population of 280,000, a shopping catchment 
of over 500,000, and 2,000,000 visitors each year. The city is 
also attracting 37,168 inward commuters, which strains the 
city’s transportation system. The Greater Exeter economic 
region spends £914 million per year on energy, almost half 
of which is attributed to transportation. These challenges  
are the basis for a smart city strategy that focuses on energy 
and transportation. 

Many of Exeter’s smart city initiatives stem from Exeter City 
Futures, a community interest company (CIC) established by 
Oxygen House Investments in partnership with Exeter City 
Council. This smart city venture was founded in November 
2015 with the goal of making Exeter congestion free and 
energy independent by 2025.

4.4.2.3 Key Initiatives and Projects

Exeter City Council has partnered with Devon County 
Council to launch a smart transportation project called 
Engaged Smart Transport. The project uses real-time traffic 
and weather sensor data to understand people’s travel 
behaviour. The councils have partnered with NTT Data, an 
IT service provider specialising in smart transportation, to 
manage the program. The project also involves a consortium 
of members including: University of Exeter, which will 
provide behavioural research; Black Swan, a big data 
specialist that will provide trend analysis and prediction,  
as well as social media engagement; Imtech Traffic & Infra, 
which will provide its intelligent transportation systems; and 
Vaisala, which will provide environmental sensors that collect 
data on road conditions and weather. The project began at 
the end of 2015, and is expected to run for 2 years.

Exeter City Futures has laid out eight major challenges 
faced by the city, including increasing bicycle commutes, 
low carbon housing stock, reducing traffic flow, halving 
heavy-load vehicles, reducing Exeter’s energy consumption, 
exploring alternative energy sources, increasing active 
transportation, and on-demand shared mobility. To solve 
these challenges, Exeter City Futures set up the Urban Impact 
Accelerator, which aims to connect with entrepreneurs 
and help them build businesses and social enterprises that 
deliver Exeter’s goal of becoming congestion free and energy 
independent. The Accelerator grants up to £15,000 to teams 
chosen to solve Exeter’s Challenges, and provides support 
such as one-on-one coaching and investor interaction.  
The 15-week programme concludes in a Demo Day, where 
teams have a chance to pitch their ideas to investors for up 
to £200,000 and receive ongoing funding opportunities and 
support. Currently, several challenges have been allocated to 
Accelerator teams; Exeter’s Energy Consumption Challenge 
has accepted applications and teams are being reviewed; 
and increasing bicycle commutes, low carbon housing stock, 
and reducing traffic flow are opportunities that will be 
available to Accelerator teams in the future. 

Exeter City Futures’ is also developing education projects 
with schools to teach students to analyse data from the 
Exeter City Council and sustainability projects that help local 
businesses cut emissions and become more energy efficient. 

Exeter’s sustainability goals are driven by a group called 
Exeter & East Devon Growth Point, which focuses on  
the nexus between economic growth and sustainability. 
Though many of the Growth Point’s project are specifically 
related to expanding green spaces and parks in the region, 
the group has also evaluated its sustainability goals based 
on analysis of its emissions. In response to this evaluation 
and the national government targets for sustainability, the 
Growth Point group has identified several key commitments 
for the city. These include designing and building all 
dwellings to the government’s Code for Sustainable  
Homes Level 4 and above, and exceeding the BREEAM  
rating of Very Good for non-residential developments.  
The Growth Point has also set energy targets, which include 
producing 16.7% of the new community’s energy from 
renewable sources and producing 10% of non-residential 
developments’ energy from renewable sources.

4 City Assessments



66 |  UK Smart Cities Index 2017

5.1 
Aims of This Study
The aim of the UK Smart Cities Index is to provide an 
assessment of the current state of smart city development 
through a detailed comparison of the 20 leading smart cities. 
The evaluation highlights their strategies, key projects,  
and overall readiness to develop their smart city visions.  
The study also highlights lessons to be learnt from these early 
adopters and areas where cities, the national government, 
and other stakeholders need to act to accelerate smart city 
development in the UK.

Navigant Research has prepared this white paper to provide 
an independent analysis of the current development of smart 
cities in the UK. The report is intended for city leaders and 
managers responsible for smart city projects, government 
agencies and other bodies supporting cities, and suppliers 
seeking to better understand the smart city market. 

The major objective of this Navigant Research white paper 
is to provide a timely assessment of the leading cities, 
including their strategy for smart city development and their 
execution against that strategy. Note that the city rankings 
capture the city’s standing at the time of the report and are 
not a retrospective of past accomplishments or an indication 
of future success. The ratings are likely to change rapidly as 
cities accelerate their smart city plans and projects.

5.2 
Evaluation Method 
The 20 cities were selected on the breadth and depth of  
their smart or future city strategy and specific programmes  
in areas such as digital innovation, social care, urban mobility, 
energy, education, and sustainability. The assessment also 
looks at the extent of their partnerships and collaboration 
with other agencies and the private sector. A detailed 
comparison was made of the top 20 cities to identify the 
current leaders and their closest challengers. 

The city evaluations in this report are based on Navigant 
Research’s corpus of smart city research; public documents 
on city strategies, projects, and performance; interviews with 
city leaders and project teams; and interviews with other key 
stakeholders in the development of smart cities from the 
public and private sector. 

5.3 
Evaluation Criteria 
The city evaluations for this Index are based on two 
dimensions: Strategy and Execution. The Strategy dimension 
assesses each city’s vision, goals, and objectives as they 
relate to its smart city programme. The Execution dimension 
assesses the city’s actual achievements from initial projects 
to full-blown deployment of innovative technologies  
and services.

Each dimension is split into five evaluation categories. 
The evaluation categories for the Strategy dimension 
are as follows:

•  Vision: Assesses a city’s smart or future city strategy, 
including an assessment of the clarity, comprehensiveness, 
and depth of the strategy. An assessment was also made 
of the leadership commitment in each city and the level of 
engagement with all stakeholders. 

•  Digital Innovation: Assesses a city’s strategy to  
develop and exploit digital technologies and services, 
including plans for the development of the city’s 
communications infrastructure, its open data policy, 
digital inclusion strategy, and plans for developing  
the local digital economy. 

•  Service Innovation: Assesses a city’s strategy for 
innovations in local services that exploit improvements 
offered by smart technologies, including plans in the  
areas of council services, social care and healthcare, 
education and skills, and transport and urban mobility.

•  Sustainability Plans: Evaluates a city’s sustainability 
strategy and the explicit targets set for energy 
consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and related 
goals in the areas of waste management, transport 
programs, air quality, and other environmental initiatives. 

•  Stakeholder Engagement: Examines the range of  
city stakeholders involved in the development of the  
smart city strategy, including citizen engagement 
programs, business involvement (particularly local SMEs 
but also significant partnerships with larger players),  
and the involvement of local universities and other 
research organisations.

Section 5

SCOPE OF STUDY  
AND METHODOLOGY



UK Smart Cities Index 2017  | 67 

5 Scope of Study and Methodology

The evaluation categories for the Execution  
dimension are:

•  Implementation: Assesses the city’s overall progress in 
translating its strategy into action based on the number, 
range, and extent of projects implemented to date. It 
also assesses forward momentum in terms of projects in 
process and the near-term pipeline for new projects  
and programmes. 

•  Digital Delivery: Evaluates progress on implementing  
the city’s digital strategy, including pilot projects, smart 
city demonstrators, and full-scale projects spanning all 
forms of digital innovation including IoT projects, open 
data platforms, and other big data programs, digital 
inclusion projects, and improvements to the city’s 
communications infrastructure. 

•  Service Delivery: Evaluates progress on implementing 
service innovations defined in the city’s smart city 
strategy, including improving access to core services, 
innovative projects for social care and healthcare, 
improvements in skills and education related to the 
use of digital technologies, urban mobility innovations, 
innovations to support local businesses, and programmes 
aimed at providing improved information and services for 
visitors and residents.

•  Environmental Impact: Looks at achievements against 
sustainability targets and implemented environmental 
and sustainability programmes, including smart energy 
projects, low carbon transport initiatives, energy efficiency 
programmes (such as smart street lighting and smart 
waste projects), and other environmental programmes.

•  Community Reach: Assesses the engagement across 
multiple communities, the involvement of local businesses 
and academic communities in smart city projects, and the 
extension of projects into the wider city region and other 
local agencies.

5.4 
The Index Rankings
Navigant Research scored the cities in the UK Smart Cities 
Index according to four categories: Leaders, Contenders, 
Challengers, and Followers. These categories are defined 
below. 

5.4.1 Leaders
Leaders are cities that scored 75 or above in both Strategy 
and Execution. These cities have differentiated themselves 
through the clarity, breadth, and inclusiveness of their smart 
city vision and planning. They are also leading the way in 
implementing significant projects at both the pilot and 
increasingly full-scale levels.

5.4.2 Contenders
Contenders are cities that scored above 50 in both Strategy 
and Execution but are not yet Leaders. Whilst these cities 
have done much to establish their smart city strategy and 
have implemented some significant projects, there are 
still some gaps in their strategy, and the number of actual 
projects may fall behind that of the smart city Leaders.

5.4.3 Challengers
Challengers are cities that scored higher than 25 in both 
Strategy and Execution but are not yet Contenders for 
leadership. Whilst these cities have laid down a vision for 
their smart city endeavours and begun to deploy projects, 
execution still trails the vision outlined by a significant 
margin in some areas at least. They may have shown strong 
initiative in a few key areas but less so across the broader 
smart city areas.

5.4.4 Followers
Followers are cities that have initiated some smart city 
projects but have not yet established themselves as leading 
innovators or developed extensive smart city strategies. 
They score below 25 in either Strategy or Execution. These 
cities need to move beyond initial statements of intent and 
limited pilot projects and siloed operations to develop a 
more integrated view for city development and/or stronger 
leadership for their programmes.

The new AI engine driving 
smart city development

C
hina’s urbanization rate has risen 

37 percent in 37 years, bringing a 

host of challenges for urban areas, 

including traffic congestion and 

pollution. Driven by services and technology, 

smart city construction has emerged as a 

solution to these problems. Service drivers 

comprise customers, service requirements, and 

architecture, while technological drivers include 

AI, data, and cloud. Collaboration in terms of 

these drivers are key topics today.

Cities have numerous requirements and a vast 

range of services, with no single company 

able to provide all. A city is much like a human 

being in that it needs a brain and nervous 

system to perceive, see, and think. According 

to Dr. Zheng Zhibin, President of the Global 

Smart City Business Department, Huawei 

Enterprise BG, “Huawei is committed to 

becoming a Smart City enabler and promoter 

by providing cities with a ‘nervous system’. 

Based on its Platform + Ecosystem strategy, 

Huawei is currently developing the +AI Smart 

City Digital Platform.” The platform is based 

on Huawei’s ICT infrastructure and, through an 

industry enablement platform, integrates five 

main resources: IoT, big data + AI, video cloud, 

Geographic Information System (GIS), and 

converged communications. Huawei has also 

joined forces with its partners to build platform 

ecosystems.

Practical application shows that a digital platform 

featuring resource coordination is vital for the 

sustainable evolution of smart cities. A powerful 

AI engine not only helps strengthen a city’s 

nervous system, but also enhances its self-

learning and self-evolution capabilities.

Oleg Logvinov, the chair of IEEE P2413, believes 

that technological advancement is a key driver of 

urban development, with AI at the core of smart city 

development. City managers have been harnessing 

AI in urban planning, public safety, transportation, 

and energy to help them make scientific decisions 

and create new digital economic models.

Tianjin: AI + Smart City 

Spread over 2,000 square kilometers, Tianjin’s 

Binhai New Area (BNA) has a population of 

approximately 3 million and a GDP of around 

700 billion yuan. At the heart of BNA lies the 

Tianjin Economic-Technological Development 

Area (TEDA). 

The development of TEDA has reinforced 

the fact that the merger of smart cities with 

big data is inevitable. The company TEDA 

was founded in 2007, with the aim of building 

simple government administration platforms. 

But by 2017, TEDA had developed to the point 

that the smart city builder now faced a bigger 

challenge: building a big data system. 

TEDA’s smart city system is divided into three 

layers. On top is the service system, which 

includes various departments, such as approval, 

public transportation, and healthcare, as well as 

integrated platforms, including cross-departmental 

systems, which provide services and management 

for enterprises and residents. Below this is the 

data information layer, which comprises data 

aggregation and analysis capabilities. Then 

under this layer comes the support system layer. 

Traditionally, this is the cloud and network, but 

when it comes to building a smart city with big 

data, the data platform has higher priority.

The smart city system usually originates from 

the service layer and, in the past, data systems 

were used to support service systems. But this 

actually wastes the value of data. Data can 

directly generate value through AI, and not 

just through application platforms, by providing 

more direct services for governments, 

enterprises, and residents under an architecture 

that bases smart cities on AI and big data.

Huawei helped TEDA design an AI-based 1+4+N 

solution, comprising one IOC, four AI platforms, 

and multiple applications. Huawei’s IOC functions 

like a city brain. The IOC processes, communicates, 

and mines data collected about the government, 

enterprises, residents, Internet, and IoT. AI 

technology then enables deep analysis by this brain.

The IOC coordinates closely with the four 

AI platforms to support services such as 

Residents’ Voices, Sensing the City, Healthcare 

in the Community, and Enterprise Services. 

Applications are based on the IOC and four 

platforms to develop a happiness index that 

The smart city system usually originates from 
the service layer and, in the past, data systems 
were used to support service systems. But this 
actually wastes the value of data.

Qingdao: Land digitalization 
for smart agriculture

China has just 120 million hectares of arable land and 

imports more than 50 percent of its food. The country 

also has 100 million hectares of saline-alkali land, of 

which between 13 and 20 million hectares has the 

potential to be transformed into fertile land to produce 

more grain. Seawater rice (salt-tolerant rice) can be 

planted on saline-alkali land, making it fertile land.

Led by the scholar Yuan Longping, the seawater 

rice strain was developed by the Qingdao 

Seawater Rice R&D Center, yielding in tests 

9.3 tons per hectare in China and 7.5 tons per 

hectare in the Dubai desert. Yuan and his team 

want to transform around 6.7 million hectares of 

saline-alkali land into fertile land within 8 years. 

This would boost China’s grain production by 30 

billion tons a year and feed 80 million people – 

equivalent to a medium-sized European country 

and the number by which the population of 

China will increase over the next 20 years.

Soil digitalization based on Huawei’s IoT system 

plays a vital role in the miracle of seawater rice 

cultivation. Sensors on or under the ground collect 

information such as illumination, temperature, and 

salinity/alkalinity, which is then sent to Huawei’s 

cloud big data center over an eLTE network. 

Then, suggestions on recommended pesticides, 

directional fertilization, and pest and disease 

control are produced by the AI system, which 

in combination with expert diagnosis, helps to 

improve rice planting on the saline-alkali land and 

increase yields.

Yuan’s team and Huawei have jointly planned 

and developed a fertile soil platform for smart 

agriculture, which is helping to move agriculture 

into the fourth of four development stages:

In the agriculture 1.0 period, everything relies 

on manual labor. Agriculture 2.0 is the use of 

agricultural machinery. Agriculture 3.0 is fully 

mechanized production. And agriculture 4.0 is 

defined by whole-region, whole-chain unmanned 

agriculture with minimal interference.

Yuan’s team has three goals: step one, agricultural 

digitalization; step two, agricultural intelligence; 

and step three, the systemization of agricultural 

products.

Duisburg: Cloud computing 
and IoT 

Duisburg is a city in the Ruhr Area of central 

Germany, one of the most densely populated 

areas in Europe. Ruhr is also a major steel 

production area, but due to the smartification of 

Duisburg, the number of steel workers in the city 

has plummeted from 70,000 to 16,000. Duisburg 

is transforming from an industrial city into a 

smart city, and needs to find new growth areas 

so it can adapt to the changing times. Smart city 

construction can help accelerate the development 

of Duisburg and improve citizens’ lives.

Duisburg aimed to benefit from the opportunities 

provided by digitalization, using new ICT 

technologies to improve urban life experiences, 

promote economic growth, and attract more 

residents, enterprises, and investors. With its 

capabilities in technological innovation in cloud 

computing, big data, IoT, and AI, and its experience 

and strengths in helping cities determine their 

future directions of development, Huawei was 

a natural choice for Duisburg when it came to 

choosing a partner for its Smart City project.

At the cloud computing infrastructure layer, the 

Rhine Cloud supported by Huawei’s technologies 

provides a basic platform for Duisburg’s cloud 

strategy. It has driven technological innovation 

and the implementation of e-governance, 

transportation, IoT, and unified communications. 

With the construction of this smart foundation, 

Smart Duisburg 1.0 has been achieved.

At the IoT layer, Duisburg will use Huawei’s 5G, 

Wi-Fi, and WLAN technologies and IoT platform 

to implement the real-time perception of city 

components. This will enable the construction 

of a connected nervous system network of 

urban facilities, such as transportation, logistics, 

power, and industrial manufacturing, facilitating 

the implementation of smart living, autonomous 

driving, smart traffic lights, smart parking, and 

smart city operations. This will help bring about 

the Smart Duisburg 2.0, a stage that will be 

based on smart experiences.

In another example, this time in education, 

Duisburg has also focused on smart classrooms, 

including WANs and broadband connectivity, as 

well as free Wi-Fi. The city leverages Huawei’s 

experience in 5G, IoT, and broadband technology 

to implement smart logistics and Industry 4.0, 

which has helped improve the lives of Duisburg 

residents and make the city a more attractive 

place for investment.

Huawei is committed to being a doer in the 

field of smart cities, harnessing AI to lead new 

smart city construction. 

At the IoT layer, Duisburg will use Huawei’s 5G, Wi-Fi, and 
WLAN technologies, and IoT platform to implement the 
real-time perception of city components.

What do international espionage concerns, a Chinese truckers’ strike, and the smart cities of the future all have in                   

common? All are part of the story of how the commercial ambitions of Huawei—one of the PRC’s leading developers                   

of high-tech electronics and telecommunications equipment—could be leveraged by the Chinese Communist Party             

(CCP) to protect its wealth and prerogatives at home, and extend its surveillance reach abroad. 

 

21st-Century Strike Breaking 

 

On June 8, truck drivers at locations across China began a loosely coordinated national strike (​China Labour Bulletin​,                  
June 11). The CCP immediately banned any mention of the strike by social or traditional media (​China Digital Times​,                   
June 12). 

 

The information blackout, a common tactic for preventing the spread of large-scale industrial action, indicates that the                 

CCP’s response to the strike is likely to follow a well-worn path: Strike leaders will probably be detained by state                    

security organs. Some strike participants may be subject to criminal punishment, or stripped of their employment                

(​China Labour Bulletin​, December 2017) ​[1]​. 
 

These time-honed strikebreaking tactics have been given a new edge by the CCP’s widespread deployment of tools                 

such as networked surveillance cameras, facial recognition algorithms, and big data-enabled monitoring of social

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
media communication. These tools make it easier to identify, track, and punish people—like strikers—who threaten               

social stability (​SCMP​, May 31).  
 

Huawei is doing its part to contribute, through its development of what it calls “safe city solutions”—a marketing term                   

for smart city platforms that integrate and analyze the torrent of data generated by this proliferation of automated                  

surveillance technology. Huawei compares its flagship smart city product, its “Intelligent Operation Center”, to a smart                

city ‘brain’ that guides and makes sense of the input from the city’s ‘nervous system’—networked cameras and other                  

sensing devices— ​to provide ​comprehensible, actionable information on crime and unrest to ​police and municipal               
decisionmakers (​Huawei​, November 10, 2017).  
 

In the PRC, such decisionmakers’ prospects for promotion depend in large part upon their ability to stamp out unrest,                   

maintain social stability, and promote economic development. The demonstrated efficacy of technological solutions             

like Huawei’s may help explain the embrace of its “safe city” platform by officials in Hefei and Chengdu, two large                    

cities reportedly affected by the recent truckers’ strike (​China-ASEAN Expo​, September 2017; ​CCPSE​, May 30               
2016). 

 

For Whom the Strike Was Broke 

 

In the case of the truckers’ strike, Huawei’s safe city solutions could help to protect more than just the careers of a                      

few local officials. Using advanced surveillance tools to break strikes could also help protect the interests of other                  

large tech companies, and their politically well-connected investors.  

 

One of the truckers’ loudest complaints was about Manbang, a cell phone app some call the “Uber of trucking” that                    

lets companies hire truckers on demand; some of the most widely circulated videos of the strike feature truckers                  

yelling “down with Manbang!”. Manbang was formed in November 2017 by the merger of two competing companies,                 

giving it a monopoly on its market. Recent updates to the app have removed truckers’ ability to decide what they                    

charge; shipping fees are now determined by Mangbang itself. Some of the striking truckers say that the new                  

arrangement makes it almost impossible for them to make a living and feed their families (​Twitter​, June 11). 
 

In April 2018, several months after the merger that formed Manbang, a private equity firm named China Reform Fund                   

led a $1.9 billion private placement in the newly merged company (​China Money Network​, April 24) ​[2]​. China                  
Reform’s ultimate beneficial owners are not clear; in China, as in many other countries, this information is not always                   

available. However, there are circumstantial reasons to suspect that China Reform could be helping line the pockets                 

of individuals with powerful political connection, among them China Reform’s status as a centrally managed               

state-owned enterprise, and the state-connected private equity industry’s long history as a locus of elite corruption                

within China ​[3]​. 
 

To be sure, none of this proves that officials are using Manbang to enrich themselves, or that Huawei is helping them                     

protect their investments through the suppression of the truckers’ strike. But it does suggest that Huawei’s smart city                  

systems could be useful to CCP leaders in ways that go beyond simply protecting law and order, and extend into of                     

the protection of powerful monied interests, at the expense of the less powerful. Such a model of social control has                    

obvious attraction for elites within China. It could also potentially prove appealing for elites in other countries. 

 

Taking Huawei’s Smart City Global 

 

Huawei has successfully marketed its smart city solutions abroad. In the space of three years it doubled the number                   

of countries where its smart city technology is deployed, from twenty to forty (​Huawei​, November 14 2017; ​Huawei

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
2014). Huawei has several smart city business lines; it describes its “safe city” public safety solutions as one of its                    

most important (​Eastday​, October 31 2017).  
 

Whether Huawei’s safe city technologies are being employed by authoritarian and kleptocratic regimes to reinforce               

their rule is an understudied question. However, it is both interesting and suggestive that the list of countries where                   

Huawei’s safe city solutions were first deployed includes a number of authoritarian and hybrid regimes with close ties                  

to China, among them Russia, Pakistan, Venezuela, Laos, and Angola (​Huawei​, 2014).  
 

Since then, Huawei has branched out to democratic countries. It recently signed a contract to install safe city                  

solutions in the small city of Valenciennes in northern France, as well as the German city of ​Gelsenkirchen ​(​Xinhua​,                   
February 10 2017; ​Huawei​, Sept 7 2017). 
 

It has also made progress in selling other smart city solutions to other sub-national actors in Western Europe. For                   

example, Huawei and the German city of Duisburg recently signed a memorandum of understanding for Huawei to                 

provide Duisburg with “eGovernment” smart city solutions designed to make city bureaucracy work more effectively               

(​Huawei​, January 12).  
 

Underlying the spread of Huawei’s smart city solutions into democratic countries are concerns that the company’s                

equipment may act as a conduit for PRC intelligence gathering. Both Australia and the United States have banned                  

Huawei equipment from their telecommunications backbones over spying concerns (​VentureBeat​, February 23).  
 

“eGovernment” smart city solutions could be of particular concern in this respect, as they involve Huawei                

intermediating directly between citizen and state, with the information gathered potentially available to PRC              

intelligence services. China’s recently ratified ​National Intelligence Law codifies the obligation of PRC-based entities              
to assist in intelligence gathering. The relevant passage reads: 

 

All organizations and citizens shall, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate with, and collaborate in                

national intelligence work, and guard the secrecy of national intelligence work they are aware of. The state                 

will protect individuals and organizations that support, cooperate with, and collaborate in national             

intelligence work ​ (​ASPI The Strategist​, Mar 28)​. 
 

While there are questions as to how the law is enforced in practice, the mere existence of such a legal obligation                     

should give pause to any western municipality considering the installation of Huawei hardware as the ‘brains’ of its                  

new smart city.  

 

So too should the ways in which the PRC could use Huawei’s ‘safe city’ technology at home, as well as the ways in                       

which such technology could be deployed abroad. While the smart cities of the future could be better, more efficient                   

cities, they could also provide authoritarian regimes with previously undreamt of tools of surveillance and control.

Notes 

 

[1] One PRC worker who recently shared on social media a call for crane operators to strike described his                   

subsequent experience: “Terrifying. Because I forwarded a post about a worker strike on May 1 yesterday, the                 

Changsha Ministry of State Security collected all possible information about me within a day, including my address,                 

telephone number, work unit and more. Two hours ago they came to my workplace and demanded that I come to the                     

police station and explain myself.” (​China Change​, May 7)

[2] Other participants in the private placement include Softbank, a major Japanese technological investment firm, as                

well as CapitalG, Google’s investment arm (​Crunchbase​, April 24). Softbank has been active in the PRC, including its                  
recent establishment of a Beijing-based JV for one of its microchip design subsidiaries that could help China break its                   

dependence on foreign microchip technology (​China Brief​, May 9). 
 

[3] To elaborate further, China Reform is itself a state-run private equity firm. In the past, centrally managed                  

state-owned enterprises and private equity firms have frequently acted as the vehicles by which the families of top                  

CCP leaders amassed enormous wealth (​New York Times​, May 12 2012). Second, an examination of China                
Reform’s corporate structure reveals connections to some of the most corrupt elements of China’s party-state (​China                
National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System​, June 15). One of its important underlying entities is China’s                
state-owned tobacco monopoly, famous as an avenue by which officials siphon off state resources.

China’s Intensifying Pressure Campaign against Taiwan 

By Russell Hsiao 

 

China has significantly ramped up pressure on Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen was democratically-elected as the               

country’s president in January 2016. As Beijing’s external pressure on Taiwan grows, pressure for action is building                 

on the Tsai administration, both from the opposition as well as from within her own party. The confluence of these                    

factors will make it harder for the Tsai administration to sustain her administration’s pragmatic efforts to maintain the                  

“status quo” in cross-Strait relations without greater international support.  

 

As the United States and its partners weigh their response to Beijing’s intimidation and coercion, it is important to                   

unpack Beijing’s intensifying pressure campaign and examine its constituent parts, if only to appreciate the               

astonishing range of ways Beijing has sought to pressure Taiwan following Tsai’s ascension to the presidency. Most                 

analyses focus only on one or several aspects; but they must be considered in the aggregate, to better formulate a                    

proportionate response.  

 

China’s pressure campaign on Taiwan includes ten elements which are, generally speaking, meant to interact with                

and reinforce each other. Some are new, some are not. Most of those that are not new have seen intensified                    

application in the past two years. These elements are: poaching Taiwan’s diplomatic allies; military coercion;               

economic coercion; excluding Taiwan from international organizations; pressuring foreign corporations; pressuring           

Taiwan’s non-diplomatic allies; economic incentives; political warfare; cyber espionage; and traditional espionage.  

 

1. Diplomatic Allies 

 

Most visibly, China is poaching Taiwan’s diplomatic allies at an accelerating rate, putting to an end the unofficial                  

diplomatic truce between the two sides during the Ma Ying-jeou administration. The west African nation of Gambia                 

severed ties with Taiwan in 2013, but did not establish diplomatic ties with Beijing until March 2016, a scant two                    

months before Tsai’s inauguration. São Tomé and Príncipe switched on December 2016, while Panama severed ties                

in June 2017. In May 2018, the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso both switched their recognition to the PRC,                   

leaving Taiwan with only 18 diplomatic allies remaining. 

2. Military Coercion 

 

The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has ramped up its military exercises around Taiwan. Between August 2016 and                 

December 2017, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense tracked at least 26 aerial exercises conducted by the

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
Chinese military around Taiwan versus a total of eight in 2015 and 2016 combined (​Global Taiwan Brief​, August 30,                   
2017). Of those exercises, 15 encircled Taiwan, meaning that military aircraft either entered or exited the Bashi                 

channel or near the Ryuku Islands (​Global Taiwan Brief​, February 7). Over the same period, the PLA Navy’s maiden                   
aircraft carrier ​Liaoning conducted four long-range exercises around Taiwan: two to the west of the Taiwan Strait                 
mid-line, another two along the eastern coast of Taiwan.  

3. Economic Coercion  

 

After Tsai’s election, Beijing began limiting the number of group tours visiting Taiwan from the mainland. Taiwan                 

receives over 10 million tourists per year since 2015, of which tourists from China have comprised over 30 percent                   

(​Admin.taiwan.net.tw​). In 201​7​, even as the number of Chinese tourists dropped by around 700,000 from the                
previous year, it was still 2.7 million out of a total of 10.7 million (​Admin.taiwan.net.tw​). ​The drop hit hard the parts of                      
Taiwan’s economy that had come to rely on Chinese tourists. However, overall, the decrease in Chinese tourists was                  

largely offset by a significant increase by tourists from New Southbound Policy (NSP) target countries ​[1]​. Over 2                  
million tourists from NSP countries visited Taiwan in 2017, a 30 percent increase from 2016. Tourists visits from                  

Japan, Hong Kong & Macao, and South Korea all increased (​Taiwan News​, February 1). 

4. International Organizations  

 

Despite US efforts, for the second year in a row Taiwan was denied observer status at the World Health Assembly.                    

Beijing is closing off procedural mechanisms that permit Taiwan’s meaningful participation in such forums, through a                

combination of its direct control over their functioning, and political coercion of member nations ​[2]​. In the lead up to                    
the World Health Assembly this year, the PRC’s mission to the United Nations apparently warned a number of                  

countries that support for Taiwan’s participation could endanger their cooperation with China.  

In addition to preventing Taiwan’s meaningful participation in international organizations, Beijing is utilizing the rules               

of these institutions to further marginalize Taiwan. This was on clear display in the case of Beijing’s unilateral move in                    

announcing the northbound M-503 commercial air route along the Taiwan Strait, right before the lunar new year                 

holiday—the heaviest cross-Strait travel season—without the prior consultation the two sides had agreed upon in               

2015 (​Global Taiwan Brief​, May 2). 

5. Corporations  

 

In late April 2018, Beijing issued a directive to 44 foreign air carriers demanding that they change their designation of                    

Taiwan on their website to “Taiwan, China.” Eighteen carriers complied before the original May 25 deadline; the rest                  

asked and were granted extensions until July 25 (​China Brief​, May 31). The US government has urged US airlines to                    
ignore the Chinese demand.  

This political pressure has gone beyond airlines. The Marriott hotel chain was forced to fire one of its employees after                    

he liked a Tibet-related post on Twitter (​United Daily News​, March 4). Other companies such as Gap Inc., Daimler                   
AG’s Mercedes-Benz, Zara, Medtronic, and Costco, among others, have been forced to apologize for depicting               

Taiwan or other issues Beijing considers sensitive in a manner that do not comport with the PRC’s definition of what                    

is politically correct.  

6. Non-diplomatic partners 

 

Beijing is also forcing non-diplomatic allies of Taiwan to downgrade their relations with Taipei. Nigeria reportedly                

asked Taipei to move its representative office from the capital of Abuja to Lagos (​Focus Taiwan News Channel​, July                   
4, 2017). In Dubai (UAE), Ecuador, Bahrain, Jordan, and most recently in Papua New Guinea, Taiwan’s                

representative offices were pressured to remove any reference to the Republic of China or Taiwan in the name of                   

their ​de facto embassies (​Taiwan News​, June 14, 2017; ​Taipei Times​, June 2). China has also continued to pressure

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
those countries with which it has diplomatic ties with to deport Taiwan nationals convicted of criminal offenses to the                   

People’s Republic of China (PRC), instead of to Taiwan. This has happened in Cambodia, Kenya, and Spain, among                  

many others (​Taiwan Democracy Bulletin​, January 31).  

7. Economic Incentives 

 

In addition to punitive measures, Beijing is also attempting to entangle Taiwanese people and businesses more                

deeply with the PRC’s economy through generous economic incentives. In February 2018, Beijing announced a raft                

of 31 measures aimed at providing equal—and in some cases preferential—treatment for Taiwanese persons and               

businesses operating in China. These include measures designed to incorporate Taiwan into the PRC’s “Made in                

China 2025”—a wide-ranging industrial policy aimed at moving the Chinese industrial base up the value chain. Other                 

incentives include generous tax breaks for Taiwanese high-tech corporations, as well as equal intellectual property               

rights protection for Taiwan-owned legal entities registered in China.  

 

Other measures include allowing Taiwanese persons to participate in the national “thousand-person program”—a             

CCP-managed project designed to attract foreign talent to help with the country’s national development goals. Most                

importantly, Taiwanese professionals are now eligible to apply for various state-provided funds for the promotion of                

science and arts. These measures are worrisome over the long term, since they could further exacerbate Taiwan’s                 

“brain drain” (​Global Taiwan Brief​, March 21). 
 

8. Political Warfare 

 

While Beijing authorities continue to spurn meaningful dialogue with Taiwan’s government, it has stepped up United                

Front Work Department (UFWD) activities against Taipei. ​The UFWD is a CCP department charged with harassing                 
party-state organizations under direct CCP control to indoctrinate, mobilize, and manipulate non-CCP individuals and              

entities—PRC native and foreign alike—in service of the Party’s policy objectives (​USCC.gov​, April 5). ​In Taiwan, the                  
UFWD targets a broad range of constituencies, including aborigines, local villages and townships, youths and               

students, pro-China political parties and groups, and Taiwan military veterans (​Liberty Times​, January 15). ​Taiwan’s                
government has previously estimated that China spends at least $337.8 million per year on UFWD recruiting efforts                 

in Taiwan, but has also said it believes there might be more “invisible funding” (​Taipei Times​, January 15). 

Taiwan’s national security organs have noted a growing volume of disinformation circulating in Taiwan’s media               

space, the product of PRC “content farms”. ​Beijing is apparently using social media disinformation and propaganda                 
to generate social instability in Taiwan (​China Brief​, April 24). For instance, during a tense period in an ongoing                   
pension reform debate in Taiwan, users of LINE—the most popular messaging application on the island—and other                

internet reported a flood of messages and websites that falsely claimed that the central government was planning to                  

impose draconian restrictions on pensioners. Taiwan’s government was forced to quickly issue a statement denying               

the fake news.  

9. Cyber  

 

Although PRC hacking has made news in the US and Europe, Taiwan is the top target for China-sponsored cyber                   

espionage (​China Brief​, December 5, 2013). Indeed, Taiwan has endured more than a decade of targeted cyber-theft                 
and attacks from China of the kind that are now being directed towards larger countries. Taiwan reportedly suffered                  

20 million to 40 million attempted hacking attacks on its public sector per month in 2017 (​Taiwan News​, April 5).                    
According to the Taiwan government, most of the hacks originate from China (​Taiwan News​, April 5).  

10. Espionage

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
Taiwan is struggling to recover from the “dark decade,” a period between 2006-2016 in which more than 40                  

Taiwanese citizens were prosecuted for espionage and espionage-related crimes involving China, among them             

serving and retired officials, military officers, and businesspeople (​Global Taiwan Brief​, September 28, 2016). As               
noted by one former US government analyst: “While Taiwan faces an espionage and subversion challenge from                

China at a scale that no modern democracy has faced, its leading political parties struggle to address the problem.”                   

Indeed, “… covert Chinese activities [against Taiwan] have increased in scope, sophistication, and intensity. For the                

first time in many years, Taiwan’s national security officials see change rather than continuity as a hallmark of                  

Beijing’s intelligence and subversive operations” (​China Brief​, August 17, 2017). 

In the final analysis, it is clear that China has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen’s                  

election in January 2016. As external pressure on Taiwan grows, internal pressure on the Tsai administration is also                  

building. It is no exaggeration to say that Taipei’s is the only government on either side of the Taiwan Strait                    

committed to the peace and stability of the status quo. Maintaining the status quo, however, cannot be the                  

responsibility of Taipei alone. In the face of Beijing’s mounting pressure, the US and other like-minded nations must                  

push back against PRC coercion, lest it become even more difficult for Taipei to stay the course.

Notes 

[1] The NSP is a comprehensive strategic policy developed by the Tsai administration to strengthen economic                

engagement and deepen people-to-people exchanges between Taiwan and 18 countries in South Asia, Southeast              

Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.  

[2] Increasingly, PRC nationals oversee important multinational institutions. Interpol’s current president is a PRC              

national, as is the International Civil Aviation Organization secretary general, who was reappointed for a second                

consecutive term commencing August 2018. A PRC national also runs the International Telecommunications Union,              

an important standards setting body for the global internet (​China Brief​, June 5).

Understanding the Role of Chambers of Commerce and Industry Associations in 

United Front Work 

By Gerry Groot 

 

In 2017, following explosive allegations of CCP interference in Australian politics by mainstream Australian media               

outlets, real estate billionaire Chau Chak-Wing (周泽荣) sat for an interview with one of Australia’s major daily                 
newspapers. Chau had featured prominently in the reporting that touched off the controversy, with some reports                

singling out his donations to mainstream Australian political parties as a key vector for CCP influence and others                  

linking him to a United Nations-linked bribery scandal. When asked about allegations of his ties to the CCP, he                   

responded:  

 

For the record, I have never been a member of the Chinese Communist Party and I have never been a member of an                       

advisory group called the People’s Political Consultative Conference. As to the entity referred to … as the “United                  

Front Work Department,” I have no idea what this is ​[1]​.  
 

The United Front Work Department (中共中央统一战线工作部) is the department of the CCP charged with

consolidating support for Party policies among non-CCP members, including among individuals of Chinese descent              

overseas. It is has long been a key, albeit well concealed, element of the CCP’s foreign policy (​China Brief​, July 6                     
2017). 

 

Chau is from the Chaozhou region of Guangdong. He immigrated to Australia in the 1980s, while continuing to run                   

the PRC-based property business that would make him a billionaire (​SBS News​, May 23). Chaozhou is a particular                  
focus of United Front activity directed at overseas Chinese, because of the region’s long history as a source of                   

migrant outflows, and their subsequent economic success around the world.  

 

Chau’s interview claims were remarkable precisely because of his long, well-documented association with provincial              

and city level elements of the United Front Work Department (UFWD). Chau has been a longtime participant in and                   

leader of industry associations for overseas Chinese from Guangdong, and has been cited as a model for overseas                  

Chinese more generally by various levels of the PRC government and the CCP. This is reflected in his appearances                   

on United Front websites, such as that of Shantou, a city in Chaozhou (​The United Front of Shantou​, January 08,                    
2014), and in 2016 group photographs with the head of the United Front for Guangzhou district of Tianhe, a center of                     

commerce in one of China’s wealthiest cities (​United Front of Tianhe​, March 1, 2016). 
 

 

Chau Chak-wing’s biography on the Shantou UFWD website 

 

The available record of Chau’s ties with the UFWD can be dated back to July 2007, when he launched the                    

Guangdong Overseas Chinese Commercial Investor Industry Association in the presence of the head of the UFWD                

in Guangdong Province, Zhou Zhenlong ​[2​]. In his speech, Chau praised the work of the earlier Overseas Chinese                  
Investor association established in Guangzhou in 1990, for protecting the ‘legitimate interests’ of the investors,               

helping solve problems and for helping improving the quality and competitiveness of industry ​[3]​. Chau was also                 
direct in his acknowledgement of Zhou Zhenlong and his United Front role when launching the ​Guangdong Huaxing                 
Bank in 2011. That Chau’s links to United Front work dates back to at least 2007 was also documented in a US State                       

Department cable released by Wikileaks (​Sydney Morning Herald​, July 16, 2017). 
 

A Brief History of the UFWD and Business 

 

The UFWD’s ties with key business people through industry associations (企业协商会) is a time-honed tactic. The                
PRC was founded with the intention of building a communist society by abolishing all private property, businesses,                 

and profit. These would be replaced with state ownership of all land, property and industry. Those who had been in                    

business before 1949 were denounced as evil capitalists and exploiters of the Chinese people. The Party demanded                 

that they hand over their property and transform themselves and their thinking from capitalism to socialism. They

were forced to undergo extensive thought reform (思想改造) or brain washing (洗脑), a process so severe that                 
those on the receiving end frequently went mad or committed suicide ​[4]​.  
 

One of the key ways businesses were thus transformed was through the use of corporatist organizations established                 

by the UFWD to represent them, most notably the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) for small                  

business, and the so-called China Democratic National Construction Party for larger ones. Nearly all “bourgeois               

elements” (中产阶级分子) were forced to join one or the other of these organizations. Then and now, not joining                  
these organizations is not an option ​[5]​.  
 

Many of the members of these two organizations, if not nearly all, became scapegoats and were subjected to harsh                   

treatment—and in some cases even torture and execution—in political campaigns initiated by CCP leader Mao               

Zedong, most famously during the so-called Anti-Rightist Campaign (反右运动) of 1958-1959, and the Great              
Proletarian Cultural Revolution (伟大的无产阶级文化革命) of 1966-1976. After Mao died in 1976, the CCP,             
seeking to rebuild China’s industry and commerce, called survivors back to service under the auspices of the UFWD.                  

One of their most important tasks was rebuilding ties to prominent Chinese overseas, so as to rehabilitate the CCP’s                   

image and encourage investment in China through a dual-track strategy that incorporated appeals to patriotism with                

promises of generous treatment and healthy profits ​[6]​. 
 

The UFWD and Business Today 

 

China’s spectacular economic rise in the years since has generated a vastly increased decree of economic and                 

social complexity. It is one of the jobs of the UFWD to survey, understand, and manage the ways in which this                     

complexity is to be organized, controlled, and represented. While the role of ACFIC has increased, the UFWD has                  

also allowed a proliferation of small industry-specific organizations, with two goals in mind: to account for rapidly                 

emerging interest groups, and integrate them into both the general political and surveillance system, and the United                 

Front system in particular. Among these organizations are the large number of newly founded provincial and                

municipal ‘chambers of commerce.” 

 

This United Front is organized along corporatist lines, and therefore creates or permits the creation of                

organizations—such as chambers of commerce—to cater to new social groups. In return for this license the UFWD                 

controls or oversees their administration. Potential leaders are carefully vetted to ensure they support the CCP, as                 

well as its key positions, even on external issues such as the status of Taiwan. Leaders are expected to publicly                    

support the party when called upon, to promote the goals at all times, and to extend the influence of United Front                     

work whenever possible, both at home and abroad. They are expected to use their personal influence and                 

professional reputations to model proper behavior, and to inform the department of the needs, complaints and                

thinking of their members. They are often able to use these political connections to solve practical problems for the                   

organization’s members as noted by Chau in his comments about the history of the Overseas Chinese Investors                 

Associations. 

 

The reward for those who pass UFWD vetting is clear recognition as political leaders, endorsed as reliable by the                   

party. With this trust comes increased access to government and party officials, as well as access to material support                   

for their needs, business and otherwise. If a business can help achieve party goals, then even more support is likely.                    

The benefit of membership for ordinary members varies but often revolves around the connections made with fellow                 

members. Political education is just part of the package. Amongst the most spectacular interventions to serve United                 

Front work was the CCP’s rescue of Tung Chee-hwa’s shipping empire shortly before his appointment as the first                  

chief administrator of Hong Kong following the city’s return to China (​The Independent​, November 24, 1996).

Putting Up a Front 

 

Despite the above, foreigners doing business in China may never encounter the United Front aspects of Chinese                 

businesses, because they might only ever deal with what they know of as chambers of commerce. In reality the                   

chambers are other side of the industry association coin, part of a ‘two nameplates – one office’ policy: ‘Industry                   

Association’ on one plate and ‘Chamber of Commerce’ on the other. Chambers of commerce provide a useful face                  

for dealings with foreigners, while associations allow the UFWD to discretely manage more directly political aspects.                

Considering the recent fate of the State Administration of Religious Affairs—a government ministry that was               

absorbed wholesale into the UFWD—we might perhaps expect to see the same occur to the chambers of commerce                  

(See ​China Brief​, April 24). 
 

Given the UFWD’s close oversight of all industry associations, their part in the wider United Front system including                  

the CPPCCs, and the desirability of becoming a leader in one, it would be impossible for any successful Chinese                   

business person not to know what they are or who they are dealing with. On the contrary, the more ambitious and                     

influential one is, the more benefits to be gained and the more valuable one is to united front work. As for Mr. Chau                       

and his association with the United Front, despite his denial of any involvement with the CCP, he appears to have                    

received the ultimate reward: an invitation to Beijing in late November 2017 to meet Xi Jinping himself (​Sydney                  
Morning Herald​, December 1, 2017).

The Lessons China Taught Itself: Why the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Matters 

By Abigail Grace 

 

China’s changing political landscape and the recent accession of India to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization               

(SCO) marks the beginning of a new chapter for one of China’s first self-founded multilateral groupings. First                 

established in June 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, the Shanghai              

Cooperation Organization’s initial activities were primarily focused on security, namely combatting the “three             

evils”—terrorism, separatism, and extremism (​Shanghai Cooperation Organization​, June 15 2001). This year’s            
leader-level summit marks the first instance in which Indian Prime Minister Modi will join the grouping as a full                   

member, introducing a democratic counterweight into an organization historically dominated by China, and to a               

lesser degree, Russia.  

 

Despite this unique constellation of actors, Western onlookers have frequently discounted the relevance and              

importance of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (​Council on Foreign Relations​, October 14 2015). Highlighting              
internal dissent between China and Russia, few tangible outcomes, and an under-emphasis on strengthening              

economic partnerships, critics of the organization paint the grouping as ineffectual. Largely absent from previous               

outcome-focused Western analyses is a close look at the lessons that China itself has learned on advancing its                  

geostrategic interests through multilateral organizations. 

 

A review of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s activities reveals that China perceives the organization as a                

blank canvas to hone its own approaches to leading on the international stage. Chinese official newspapers and                 

netizens have described the organization as a forum for China to explore and implement a new model of international                   

relations. Moreover, official releases from the SCO itself acknowledge the need for the group to continue refining                 

coordination and organization mechanisms, indicating that China’s strategy for engaging the organization is evolving              

as the SCO’s issue set expands in scope. Thus, the current value of the SCO is as a forum for China to define and                        

articulate its interests, shape the focus of international institutions based on its own domestic priorities, lobby its                 

neighbors to adopt its approach, and codify those views within an internationally legitimate multilateral process. 

 

Creation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization 

 

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization was preceded by the Shanghai Five, which was created in April 1996 by all                  

SCO founding member states, excluding Uzbekistan. The Shanghai Five’s initial mandate was limited in scope and                

focused on the demilitarization and clear delineation borders within the region (​Xinhua​, June 21 2016). Thus, China’s                 
initial step into this multilateral grouping was driven by a strategic necessity stemming from the collapse of the Soviet                   

Union and the need for clear territorial boundaries, rather than a broader plan to imbue Eurasia with multilateralism.  

 

From its first days, the SCO positioned itself as an organization premised on learning from the past. At the SCO’s                    

founding ceremony CCP Chairman Jiang Zemin stated, “facing profound lessons…each country’s people fervently             

hopes that humanity is able to take a step towards peace and development.” (​Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs​,                  
June 22 2001). In its early stages, the SCO remained primarily focused on counterterrorism activities. The intense                 

focus on this issue set was motivated by China’s need to elicit cooperation from Central Asian states in its campaign                    

to stem Uyghur separatism. Given the high population of Uyghur citizens in other SCO member states, garnering law                  

enforcement cooperation from Central Asian countries (many of whom might have been sympathetic to the Uyghur’s                

plight) was viewed as an important step in safeguarding China’s domestic security by Chinese Communist Party                

(CCP) officials.

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
Broadening the SCO’s Aperture 

 

As time passed, and China’s grip on the security situation in Xinjiang tightened, Chinese officials advocated the                 

expansion of the SCO’s mandate. In 2004, official SCO documents began to increasingly emphasize the “further                

development and deepening of the SCO cooperation on trade, economic, investment” (​Shanghai Cooperation             
Organization​, September 23 2004). These preliminary discussions served as a precursor to China’s Belt and Road                
Initiative. By 2006, the SCO was highlighting the role of information and communications technology (ICT) in its                 

forward planning documents, and openly acknowledging that ICT could cause “serious damage to the security…and               

non-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states” (​Shanghai Cooperation Organization​, June 15, 2006).              
Despite the gradual broadening of the SCO’s activities, at its core, the organization remained a regionally-focused                

grouping, which it acknowledged itself in its Fifth Anniversary Declaration (​Shanghai Cooperation Organization​, June              
15 2006).  

 

Many external observers have describe the global financial crisis of 2008 as a turning point for China’s view of its                    

place in the world. The SCO reflected this shift, as it began to broaden what had been a narrow regional agenda.                     

That year, the organization issued formal guidance on how external states could accede as dialogue partners,                

acknowledged the importance of the SCO’s work to develop an international legal framework for ICT standards, and                 

promoted deepening relations between the SCO and other multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations (UN)                

and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (​Shanghai Cooperation Organization​, August 28 2008). The              
SCO’s work on ICT is particularly noteworthy, as it both presaged and proceeded in concert with an evolution of                   

Chinese rhetoric on ICT standards into a robust defense of “cyber sovereignty.” The complementary nature of                

China’s work in the SCO with its work in other multinational fora is underscored by its repeated efforts to use the                     

United Nations as a means to legitimize and extend China’s illiberal ICT governance norms across new domains                 

(​China Brief,​ June 5). 
 

Despite this expanded vision for the organization’s work, few concrete developments and new economic instruments               

emerged from China’s increased efforts (​Russia in Global Affairs​, August 8 2007). Onlookers attributed this to                
Russia’s distaste with former Soviet republics moving closer into China’s economic orbit (​Carnegie Moscow Center​,               
June 23 2017). Increasingly, China’s own goals for deepening financial ties with Central Asia came into conflict with                  

Russia’s security-centric priorities for the organization.  

 

China’s Changing Perception of its Role in the World 

 

As China’s perception of its own role in the world evolved, its expectations for regional engagement shifted as well.                   

The Chinese Communist Party’s 18​th Party Congress marked the beginning of Secretary General Xi Jinping’s tenure                
and a sharp shift in how China perceived itself within the existing international order. As Xi has centralized power and                    

his policy priorities have become paramount within the CCP, China’s foreign policy objectives have changed               

accordingly. Chief among Xi’s initiatives is to “unremittingly strive” for the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”                 

by 2049, the centennial of the founding of the People’s Republic of China (​Xinhua News​, October 18 2017). The                   
practical implications of Xi’s pledge to achieve this “great rejuvenation” (伟大的复兴) are not straightforward, but it                
may be most appropriate to envision it as an effort for China to return to what it views as its rightful role as a leader                         

within the region. 

 

The foreign policy implications of the great rejuvenation are evident in China’s expanding economic engagement with                

countries on its periphery. China initially attempted to achieve these enhanced ties through the auspices of the SCO                  

(​The Diplomat​, December 5 2013). Despite that process’s lack of tangible outcomes, with the introduction of the Belt                  
and Road Initiative, China was able to build on the framework of bilateral engagement with individual SCO member                  

states to shape the group’s receptiveness towards Chinese investment. In September 2013, Chinese President Xi

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
Jinping delivered a landmark speech announcing the initiative at Kazakhstan’s Nazarbayev University. Focusing             

heavily on the historic links between imperial China’s dependence on the Silk Road and modern China’s need to                  

expand regional economic cooperation, President Xi delineated China’s past and future engagement with Central              

Asian states.  

 

As China has realized success with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in its bilateral dealings with SCO member                   

states, China’s Foreign Ministry is increasingly linking BRI to the upcoming work of the SCO itself. Indeed, a key                   

deliverable for the 2018 SCO Summit was the “strengthening of ties” between the SCO countries and the Belt and                   

Road Initiative, which, “have been closely related…from the very beginning” (​Xinhua News​, June 9 2018).  
 

India’s Accession 

 

Although China has succeeded in gaining Russian support for the Belt and Road Initiative over the past five years,                   

India’s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization introduces another actor, one that is keen to check                

China’s ambitions for regional hegemony. At the 2018 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s Foreign               

Ministers, India refused to endorse the Belt and Road Initiative, highlighting a fissure between the members                

(​Shanghai Cooperation Organization​, April 24 2018). Despite this public split, both China and India have used the                 
2018 SCO Qingdao Summit to highlight regional cooperation rather than competition (​Narendra Modi​, June 9 2018).  
 

Although India’s inclusion will undoubtedly limit China’s free reign to use the SCO as a forum to garner legitimacy for                    

its more controversial political positions, broadening the SCO’s aperture could position the organization as a more                

credible voice in the international community. However, on controversial issues such as ICT standards, India could                

constraint the SCO’s ability to forcefully advocate for Beijing and Moscow’s preferred positions at the United Nations.                 

In contrast to the SCO’s 2017 Astana Declaration, the 2018 Qingdao Declaration notably declined to endorse the                 

SCO’s 2015 ICT standards submission to the United Nations (​Shanghai Cooperation Organization​, June 9 2017;               
Shanghai Cooperation Organization​, June 10 2018). 
 

China’s Role as a Leader of Multilateral Institutions 

 

Altogether, the 2018 Qingdao Declaration totals two thousand more words than the SCO’s 2017 Astana Declaration                

and includes references to issues as diverse as infectious diseases, e-trade, Afghanistan’s peace process, the               

Syrian Civil War, international trade barriers, peace on the Korean Peninsula, disarmament and nonproliferation,              

state sovereignty, counterterrorism, drug-trafficking, anti-corruption efforts, and a host of other topics (​Shanghai             
Cooperation Organization​, June 10 2018).  
 

That China’s Foreign Ministry was able to lead multilateral negotiations on such an array of issues demonstrates their                  

bureaucrats’ attention to detail, diplomatic deftness, and desire to influence policy outcomes on a broad range of                 

matters, many of which may not produce tangible impacts for years to come. By building multilateral support for                  

emerging issue sets that remain underdiscussed within developing countries, China is benefitting from a “first mover”                

approach to international relations, where it is able to set the parameters and define success on matters that will be                    

of critical importance to future generations.  

 

As China’s own domestic priorities, clout within the international community, and approach to engagement with               

pre-existing international organizations shifted, its approach to the SCO evolved as well. The case study of the                 

SCO’s engagement with China’s Belt and Road Initiative demonstrates that, when stymied multilaterally, China will               

use bilateral mechanisms to generate support for its own priorities. Furthermore, although the expansion of the                

issues included in SCO communiques demonstrates diplomatic agility on the part of China’s Foreign Ministry, if the                 

organization focuses efforts too broadly, then it runs the risk of losing its ability to prioritize high-impact issues.

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
In the years to come, it remains to be seen if China itself will adhere to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization’s                    

pledge to advance this “new type of international relations” defined by equality among all states and domestic                 

political non-interference, or if China’s own “great rejuvenation” will impinge upon those in its periphery. What is                 

certain is that China’s engagement in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has taught Beijing valuable lessons on                

how to form, shape, and engage “new models” of international organizations.

Next Steps in the Merger of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Belt and Road 

Initiative  

By Greg Shtraks  

 

On June 9th, 2018 the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) held its annual summit at the Chinese seaside city                  

of Qingdao. The past three summits have been preoccupied with the impending membership of India and Pakistan,                 

but now that the two are full members, the focus has shifted. Both pre- and post-summit statements suggest that one                    

of the highlights of the conference was the unveiling of concrete steps towards the merger of the Eurasian Economic                   

Union (EAEU) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The initial merger of the two organizations was announced in                   

May of 2015, just four months after the EAEU’s launch, but there has thus far been little visible progress of                    

integration. Still, over the last three years the EAEU and BRI have gradually evolved and the announcement of actual                   

projects can be seen as a victory for both China and Russia.  

 

The Eurasian Economic Onion: Many Layers, Few Nutrients  

 

The EAEU was ostensibly created as a Eurasian alternative to the European Union, with the goal of building a                   

common market without internal barriers. Despite its name, the EAEU was envisioned by Moscow as a geopolitical                 

rather than an economic animal. It was to be akin to a new Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), but with                    

real, functioning institutions whose main organ, the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), would be headquartered              

in Moscow, while a new Court of the EAEU would be based in Minsk, and a financial regulator would make a home in                       

Almaty (​cer.eu​, March 16 2017).  
 

Although these grandiose dreams have not been realized, the EAEU does have a well-structured institutional               

organization, which is perhaps the greatest advantage it has to offer the BRI in any potential merger. The EAEU’s                   

most important decisions are made by the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council, which is composed of the heads of                  

member states, while a secondary level, consisting of prime ministers, roughly corresponds to EU’s Council of                

Ministers. Most of the day-to-day bureaucratic work is conducted by the EEC (​Russian Analytical Digest​, May 3,                 
2016). These bodies could potentially streamline policies and facilitate the construction of the infrastructure              

envisioned by the BRI. They can also enact and enforce the various legal arrangements that may be agreed to as                    

part of an EAEU-BRI merger.

China​Brief         Volume 18 • Issue 11 • June 19, 2018 
Despite Russia's ideological and geopolitical aspirations, in practice the EAEU has remained a purely economic               

institution. The organization has functioned primarily as a limited customs union, whose most successful element has                

been the improvement of cross-border commercial transit (​New Eastern Europe​, January 9). The EAEU has also                
raised external tariffs on imports from non-EAEU countries and thus made products from within the EAEU more                 

competitive. In addition, the EAEU has eased conditions for laborers from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan who are                

working in Russia by eliminating burdens, including mandatory language tests, and payment for a monthly work                

permit (these hurdles remain for workers from non-EAEU countries). This matters especially for Kyrgyzstan, which               

derives 25.7 percent of its GDP from labor remittances (​crisisgroup.org​, July 27).  
 

The EAEU has also served as a useful platform for the creation of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with foreign                   

countries. Thus far, Vietnam, Moldova, Uzbekistan and, most recently, Iran have signed FTAs with the EAEU. It is                  

likely that the ""agreement on trade and economic cooperation"" with China, announced in May and elaborated upon at                  

the Qingdao summit, will be based on the same premises as these previous agreements.  

  
These notable successes notwithstanding, the EAEU faces many problems. First and foremost among these is that                

the Union was born just as Russia's economy began to crumble under the weight of low energy prices, international                   

sanctions, and Moscow's subsequently imposed counter-sanctions. Russia's economy accounts for 84 percent of             

EAEU GDP; its stagnation has sapped the union’s forward momentum, as Russia's trade with EAEU partners fell by                  

15 billion US dollars year-on-year in 2015, and declined further in 2016 before rebounding slightly in 2017 (​Chatham                  
house​, May 2 2017). The collapse of the Ruble only worsened the problem, cheapening Russian goods and hurting                  
other countries’ competitiveness vis-a-vis Russia. Secondly, little headway has been made in creating a common               

market for oil, gas, and electricity, all of which are supposedly among the union’s main goals. Third, non-tariff barriers                   

remain a huge problem in many sectors (​cer.eu​, March 16 2017). Although efforts have been made to liberalize the                   
services market in areas such as construction, engineering, agriculture, retail, and wholesale trade, the opening has                

been slow and only partial. 

 

The EAEU remains popular among the elite of all five member countries and, according to polls, retains public                  

support. Its existence is secure for the short and medium term, but its influence will largely depend on how closely it                     

is integrated with the BRI. The EAEU, as a relatively new creation, lacks the deep set norms that define older                    

institutions. This immaturity could work in its favor, however, as it could mature alongside the BRI, as the two                   

mechanisms develop jointly without infringing on each other's core interests.  

  
The Nebulous One Belt, One Road Initiative  

 

Contrary to its name, the Xi administration’s flagship foreign policy initiative actually includes six different ""economic                

corridors"": four for the Silk Road Economic Belt and two for the Maritime Silk Road (​ndu.edu​, October 4). Integration                   
with the EAEU focuses on three: the New Eurasian land bridge connecting China with Europe via Kazakhstan, the                  

China-Central Asia-West Africa Economic Corridor, and the China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor (​National           
Bureau of Asian Research​, July 15).  
  

Unlike the EAEU, which was clearly modeled on the European Union, BRI has no real precedent. Some                 

commentators have compared it to the Marshall Plan, although the proposed financial scope of the BRI is actually far                   

larger. For example, the National Silk Road Fund (with a $40 billion endowment) is directly responsible for financing                  

BRI projects, although its only large investment to date was its purchase of an equity stake in a Russian liquefied                    

natural gas project on the Yamal Peninsula (​Xinhua​, November 1). The BRICS Bank is headquartered in Shanghai                 
and has $70 billion at its disposal. Most important is the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), with $100 billion                   

in capital ​[1]​. These three nascent financial institutions were all created within the last five years and have yet to truly

flex their muscle. But their potential is substantial, despite the fact that, five years into its existence, the BRI remains                    

somewhat nebulous from a bureaucratic implementation standpoint. 

 

“Trade and Economic Cooperation"": The Meaning of Agreement 

 

Immediately following the May 2015 signing of the Joint Statement on Cooperation on the Construction of Joint                 

EAEU and the Silk Road projects, a Sino-Russian joint working group met in Beijing to define key issues for                   

EAEU-BRI cooperation. They concluded that the key areas would be: major infrastructure projects, the creation of a                 

system for the protection of mutual investments, and the creation of mechanisms for the resolution of investment                 

disputes (​iorj.hse.ru​, December 8, 2016). The notion of an “agreement on trade and economic cooperation”, as                
opposed to a more conventional free trade agreement, was first proposed in September 2016 at a meeting of experts                   

organized by the Eurasian Economic Commission (​journals.aau.dk​, June 29).  

 

The idea found traction, and in May 2018 the two sides signed a Sino-EAEU agreement that is expected to take                    

effect at the beginning of 2019. In an interview with Xinhua, Tigran Sargsyan, the chairman of the board to the                    

Eurasian Economic Commission, said that the treaty ""creates a serious legal framework for the interaction of                

businesses and makes the environment in which they will operate predictable. The proper alignment of transport                

infrastructure and logistics holds serious potential, and 40 specific projects in the sectors of rail transport, road                 

transport, and other types of infrastructure are currently under discussion"" (​Xinhua​, June 5).  
 

It is likely that among the 40 projects that Sargsyan mentions are the Moscow-Kazan high speed railroad and the                   

Western Europe-Western China expressway that would connect Lianyungang with St. Petersburg. Additionally, there             

are several hydropower projects in the Russian Far East that will be financed by Chinese investment (​Central Asia                  
Institute for Strategic Studies​, July 15). The list also likely includes the agreement between the Russia Direct                 
Investment Fund and the China Development Bank to create a new $10 billion cooperation fund for cross border                  

projects, as well as the $850 million loan that the China Development Bank gave to the Russian VEB bank for the                     

construction of an innovation fund (​Gazetta.ru​, May 29). It would not be surprising, however, if the majority of these                   
projects were in Kazakhstan rather than in Russia, as Astana has worked hard to incorporate its ""Nurly Zhul""                  

infrastructure initiative with BRI. On the other hand, there has been a noticeable rise of anti-Chinese sentiments in                  

Kazakhstan that may preclude some of these projects from reaching fruition (​Eurasia Daily Monitor​, January 8). It                 
also remains unclear what the “legal framework” that Sargsyan alluded to actually entails, although the Valdai                

Discussion Club, a Russian think tank that has published papers on Russia's Asia policy, has suggested it could                  

encompass sectoral and customs cooperation, sanitary measures, technical barriers, intellectual property protection,            

and greater transparency in trade remedy actions (​Valdai Discussion Club​, September 8). 
  

Conclusion  

 

It is possible that Vladimir Putin's vision of a greater Eurasia may have grown to include a free trade zone that                     

extends from the borders of Poland to the Yellow Sea. This notion of a “greater Eurasia” has cropped up throughout                    

the writings of Russian policy experts, such as Sergei Karaganov and Dmitryi Efremenko, and is seen by many as a                    

paradigm for Russia’s geopolitical strategy in the second decade of the 21​st ​century (​Russia International Affairs                
Council,​ September 1).  
 

The concept seeks to encompass a number of different trends that have defined Russian diplomacy over the last                  

several years, namely, the “turn to the east”, the establishment of the Eurasian Economic Union, and the attempt to                   

reinvigorate the Russian Far East. Interestingly, many Russian experts are looking to the SCO as the negotiating

venue for this “greater Eurasia” partnership—a perspective that is certain to be met with approval by Beijing (​Russian                  
Analytical Digest​, May 3, 2016).  
 

It appears that Russia and China share a long term vision for the Eurasian region. Smaller actors such as                   

Kazakhstan and Mongolia will have to fine tune their foreign policy to meet the new challenges presented by Moscow                   

and Beijing’s renewed focus on Central Asia. In addition to multilateral conferences, the SCO summit in Qingdao was                  

replete with bilateral and trilateral sideline meetings between various actors in this new great game. Eurasia is                 

coming into focus on the world stage. Somewhere, Halford Mackinder is smiling.

blocked by Russia. Now, however, the tables have turned and it is the Russians who are more interested in the SCO

New ICT Enables Smart City



Cities are the economic engines of their host countries, 
generating more that 80% of global GDP1. They also con-
sume two-thirds of the world’s energy and produce over 
70% of global CO2 emissions.2 In 2014, the urban popu-
lation was 54% of the total population and this number 
will increase by an additional 2.5 billion people by 2050 
with 66% of the global population living in urban envi-
ronments.3 This continued growth in concentrated urban 
populations will have significant ramifications for the 
future and will worsen current challenges such as traf-
fic, access to clean water, crime rates, and the growth of 
slums or informal settlements.

The global interest in Smart Cities is at its highest level 
since the Smart City movement began, and cities are at a 
tipping point for investing in research and pilots as well as 
in large, scalable, and transformative deployments (much 
of the latter spurred by monies from national agencies). 
The growth in cities combined with recent technological 
advances have come together to shift attention to smart 
cities and Smart City-related technologies. This interest is 
driven by the opportunities that Smart City initiatives can 
provide as they use operational technologies, civic tech-
nologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the 3rd Platform 
(cloud, social, mobile, and big data/analytics) to understand 
the workings of a city at a level of unprecedented detail, 
provide new and innovative services to residents and local 
businesses, and change the collective behavior of gov-
ernment workers, local business, and residents to achieve 
broad social, environmental, and financial outcomes.  

Smart City technologies are 
differentiators for the cities that deploy 
them. IDC believes that Smart City 
technologies and initiatives will play 
a key role in helping municipalities 
tackle these growing challenges and 
compete more effectively in a global 
digital economy. Smart Cities harness 
the power of technology and drive 
local innovation to create jobs, provide 
a safe and high quality of life for 
residents, and attract talent, tourists, 
and visitors. In order to do this, however, 
city leaders need concrete strategic 
plans, investment strategies, and better 
information on the best practices of 
successful Smart City implementations 
to reduce risk and improve outcomes. 

The potential impact of a Smart 
City transformations should not be 
understated. With current and projected 
urban populations, these solutions 
can touch the majority of people in the 
world making them safe and supporting 
most of the global economic growth. 
With quality of life improvements as a 
fundamental tenet of Smart Cities, it is 
up to cities to leverage data, technology, 
and people to affect change and design 
their cities.

Competing Pressures to Transform

Whereas government organizations 
used to speak about e-government, 
the conversation, function and theme 
of Smart Cities is more broadly stated 
in terms of digital transformation of 
citizen services and daily operations. 
Cities and local governments around 
the world are under pressure to improve 
their infrastructure, sustainability, 
and economic opportunities for 
citizens as well as transform the 
citizen experience. Following years of 
sustained underinvestment, the global 
annual infrastructure cost burden is 
estimated to be $3.3 trillion, simply to 
meet existing growth projections (http://
www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-
projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/
bridging-global-infrastructure-gaps). 
3rd platform technologies combined 
with other technologies like cognitive 
computing, video analytics and IoT offer 
unparalleled opportunities to deliver new 
government capabilities to all aspects of 
the city while sustaining budget levels. 
For example, smart parking solutions 
that guide drivers to available spaces 
deliver multiple benefits to residents, 
decreasing congestion, pollution, and 
traffic while increasing consumers to 
business districts.  

Technology as a Strategic Lever

At their core, Smart City leaders 
are embracing technology not as a 
cost center tied solely to operational 
efficiencies but as a strategic investment 
tied to programmatic outcomes, new 
services, and economic development.  
Smart City leaders understand that 
technology can impact both topline 

“revenues” in terms of the tax base 
and new services as well as ensuring 
budgets break even via operational 
efficiencies and cost savings.  The 
city of Copenhagen, Denmark has 
recently created the Copenhagen Data 
Exchange, where it is creating new 
revenue streams by aggregating and 
monetizing the various streams of data 
coming from business, citizens, utilities, 
to create entirely new services.

Smart Cities Are National Priorities

Singapore: Singapore’s Smart Nation strategy and ICT masterplans functionally animate 
the concerted desire for public sector transformation to meet the social, economic and 
political aspirations of citizens. In 2015, Singapore branded itself as the world’s first Smart 
Nation, instilling an ambitious pan-national vision, precisely when many cities globally were 
experimenting and delivering ‘Smart City’ technologies to address isolated challenges such as 
street lighting, water and waste management, and traffic light management. 

The United States: In September 2015, the U.S. White House announced new Smart Cities 
investment of $160 million for federal research and grants to help cities tackle traffic congestion, 
crime, the changing climate, and the delivery of city services. On September 26, 2016, the White 
House committed an additional $80 million in new federal funds to the Smart Cities Initiative, 
which will also double the number communities participating to over 70. 

The growing adoption and awareness of 
the Smart Cities as a catalyst for change 

China: Many of the foundational themes outlined in China’s 13th five-year plan (2016-2020) 
pertain to cultivating Smart Cities. Accelerating new urbanization and consumption, smart 
manufacturing, smart buildings and smart grid initiatives all feature prominently in the plan. China 
has been committed to Smart Cities for a number of years now; as of 2014, China had 277 cities, 
including metropolises such as Beijing and county-level urban areas, piloting Smart City projects, 
with $13 billion invested in deployments. 

Japan: Japan’s Smart Japan ICT Strategy was devised to catalyze the nation into sustainable 
growth at a pivotal moment in its history. Its national strategy seeks to foster innovation by 
connecting all manner of things, systems and services through intelligent ICT. Its vision is to 
become a knowledge, information and data-driven nation by 2020, commensurate with hosting 
the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo. Japan’s national smart cities plan is in fact 
also focused on creating international synergies. Focused keenly on its international economic 
competitiveness, Japan believes that by 2020 its national strategy will lead to annual overseas 
sales of 17.5 trillion yen, a five-fold increase over 2012.

United Kingdom: The United Kingdom has created a Ministerial Smart Cities Forum and 
the Future Cities Catapult. The Future Cities Catapult is one of seven Catapults under the United 
Kingdom’s innovation agency, the Technology Strategy Board. The Future Cities Catapult, as its 
name implies, is focused on urban environments and the technologies that will help solve urban 
challenges.

Long-term Viability for Multiple Stakeholders. Smart 
City technology investment also directly impacts 
sustainability and resilience, and the livability of a 
region (i.e. in traffic and urban mobility, public safety 
and modern education). 

 Business and residents that operate 
in the global digital economy want to 
know what continued future investment 
cities will be making for progress in 
these areas while tourists look for a city 
that is safe and easy to navigate. These 
investments require a level of innovation 
to test emerging technologies, and the 
ability to work with new combinations of 
partners, from universities to operational 
and IT companies to real estate 
developers and urban planners, and to 
be transparent and open around the 
impacts of new technologies.  New York 
City, for example, is working with local 
universities and the private sector to use 
technology to meet a variety of strategic 
goals outlined in its OneNYC vision.  
The city is using Open Data and City 
Neighborhood Labs to test technologies 
and bring more tech sector companies 
to the city as well as using smart kiosks 
to provide free, high speed WiFi to the 
public. 

As part of its FutureScape process 
this past year, IDC forecasted that “by 
2017, at least 20 of the world’s largest 
countries would create national Smart 
City policies to prioritize funding and 
document technical and business 
guidelines.”

has resulted in a more active role by 
national governments in developing 
Smart City strategies. And while the 
strength of national governments in 
relation to cities and other levels of 
government varies by country, IDC 
predicted that many more countries 
would set a national agenda for funding-
specific Smart City initiatives. To date, 
countries with national Smart Cities 
plans include:

Smart cities have entered a new, more practical phase of develop-
ment. Many cities are working on a smart vision, or have already 
articulated a smart vision, and leading cities have shown that invest-
ment can lead to success.

The Benefits of Smart Cities 

The Challenges in Smart City 
Development 

Smart Cities, while they rely on ICT 
and data, require the development of 
non-ICT related areas, like governance, 
data management, and partnership 
models, for effective implementation.  
Smart Cities transform by integrating 
technologies and operational processes; 
cities must manage the complexity 
in new and legacy IT and operational 
systems, the connection between digital 
and physical environments, creating 

supporting regulation and policy, and 
effecting behavior change in government 
employees and city residents to meet 
desired goals. The resulting complexity 
and change management can be a 
daunting task for city leaders trying to 
manage their risk while testing new and 
innovative ideas. From sharing data to 
implementing new systems like video 
analytics or next-generation emergency 
services, Smart City solutions can be 
disruptive to the status quo.

Optimize urban transportation - 
Make it easier for commuters and 
residents to shop, attend events 
and go to work through intelligent 
transportation systems, smart 
parking and many transit options, 
from subways and buses to ride-
hailing and car-sharing services.

The core goal of a Smart City is sustainable economic 
development and growth. Smart Cities use Smart 
City initiatives to attract more businesses, start-ups, 
tourists, visitors and residents. 

 More specifically, Smart Cities:

Ultimately, smart 
cities provide 
measurable 
outcomes over 
relatively short time 
periods.  As shown 
in Figure 2, there 
are many examples 
of the benefits of 
smart deployments.

Optimize city administration 
- Provide more efficient city 
operations by using IoT 
technologies to track infrastructure 
and workers in real-time and 
adjust operations on demand.  
One example of this include 
changing trash collections to 
reduce air pollution and collecting 
trash as needed when bins are full.

Deliver sustainability - Ensure 
a clean environmental by using 
environmental and water sensors 
and applications to monitor the air 
and water quality and take steps 
to reduce air pollution as well 
as alerting people of dangerous 
conditions. Smart Cities also 
include utilities that develop smart 
grids that can monitor energy 
use in real time, smart lighting 
that uses programmable LEDs 
for streets and parks, and smart 
building technologies that reduce 
energy use.

Catalyze connected healthcare 
- Enable the healthcare and 
social services support for all 
people, especially those that are 
vulnerable like the elderly, with 
home-based telehealth options 
and social programs that use 
analytics to identify causes 
of health issues like low birth 
weights, obesity or diabetes.

Modernize education - Offer 
modern educational opportunities 
for families with children and for 
college and university students by 
offering up-to-date technologies 
in classrooms, online learning 
and high speed connections, and 
partnering with universities to 
provide the city as a living lab for 
students.

Deliver public security - Provide 
a safe city for people to live in and 
for tourists to visit, using sensors, 
video cameras, police body 
cameras to support community 
policing and intelligent (even 
mobile) command centers that 
discourage and prevent crime, 
and respond more quickly to 
emergencies.

The Smart City Ecosystem

source: IDC Government Insights, 2016

Based on a global survey of business 
and government leaders, local 
government respondents indicated 
that the biggest challenges for Smart 
City IoT deployments are finding 
the budget for the initial costs of 
investments and managing the 
security and privacy concerns over 
data collections and transmission. 

Secondary concerns including handling 
ongoing costs of initiatives, such as the 
cost of monthly connectivity charges 
or software license fees, and finding 
the right stable, technical capabilities 
in solution.  These survey results are 
shown in Figure 3.

Smart City solutions also require 
working with multiple vendors for one 
solution; no one supplier can provide an 
entire Smart City solution.  And often, 
within the city itself, there are multiple 
departments and quasi-public agencies 

The Smart City ecosystem continues to grow with players from a multitude of 
sectors as shown in Figure 4.  

that will be involved.  Cities will also 
often leverage the skills from universities 
to supplement existing technical skills.

From a technology perspective, Smart Cities are made up 
of various layers — connectivity, datacenter, analytics, ap-
plications, and the end-user layer. Each one of these layers 
incorporates various types of technologies that allows for 
the creation and aggregation of data and provides the right 
level of response for end users in the city, be it a citizen, 
resident, tourist, or business. Furthermore, each technology 
layer evolves at varied paces which requires that each layer 
is decoupled so that products can be switched in and out 
as needed while continuing to interface with other layers to 
support the business.  

Smart City ARCHITECTURE In addition to the technology 
layers, a Smart City requires proper 
representation and integration of the 
city’s various stakeholders (i.e. the public 
sector, planners and developers, utilities, 
ICT and infrastructure providers, private 
companies, and investors), with the 
most important stakeholder being the 
citizen/resident. As a result, Smart City 
deployment is a complex socio-technical 
endeavor that requires systematically 
incorporating organizational, financial, 
social, operational, technology, and 
psychological components in the 
context of the human, social, business, 
political and physical environments in 
which they will be used. In essence, 
achieving Smart City goals requires 
an architectural systematic approach, 
where each component can be 
replaced, while maintaining the ability 
to organically integrate with others to 
deliver the desired capabilities. City 
leaders that do not take this systematic 
approach will be stuck with obsolete 
systems, or, worse, will waste taxpayer 
money to buy expensive bleeding-edge 
technologies that are not aligned with 
business goals. 

A multi-tier architecture implies 
a N-tiered architecture where the 
different layers – i.e. user/ presentation 
layer, application layer, data layer, 
infrastructure layer - are de-coupled 
from one another. IDC research shows 
how such an N-tiered model enables 
better scalability of capabilities, re-
usability of data and applications and 
ability to choose different delivery 
models, from on premise to public 
cloud to leverage and agile hybrid 
environment. It also helps incrementally 
move away from legacy systems 
without carrying out costly and risky 
rip-and-replace projects. This will be the 
most appropriate high-level common 
reference architecture for use across 
multiple cities that want to be able to 
leverage 3rd platform technologies to 
digitally transform (See Figure 5 below)

The third platform is IDC’s definition of 
the wave of computing platforms, driving 
by the inter-dependencies between 
mobile computing, social media, cloud 
computing, big data analytics, and 
innovation accelerators such as the 
Internet of Things. 

Through these 3rd 
platform technologies, 
ICT provides the 
capabilities required 
to build smart cities, 
laying the foundation 
for the following key 
platforms or solutions.

Connecting Service Platform

Broadly speaking, IDC defines the 
Internet of Things (IoT) as a network of 
networks of uniquely identifiable end 
points (or things) that communicate 
without human interaction using IP 
connectivity — be it locally or globally. 

IoT solutions allow businesses and governments 
to improve processes and productivity, create 
new revenue streams and competitive advantage, 
enhance customer experience and improve citizen 
service delivery. 

Connectivity

The connectivity layer includes 
the telecom network and Internet 
connectivity that enables to transmission 
of data from IoT modules, sensors and 
devices. 

The connectivity segment of the Smart 
City market can involve any of the 
following connection types and can be 
provided by private operators, co-ops, 
or municipally owned networks:

The rise of intelligent devices, or the 
IoT has been staggering. IDC estimates 
that the number of sensors in use is 
in the trillions. There were 13 billion 
connected intelligent systems in 2015, 
growing to 30 billion by 2020. This 
means that there are more than 5,000 
connected endpoints being added every 
minute. Driven by ubiquitous broadband, 
commoditized sensor technologies, 
the increased widespread availability 
of analytical tools and cloud – based 
platforms, the IoT is a foundation to 
many Smart City initiatives. This makes 
IoT connectivity management is a 
critical component of connected service 
platforms as it provides for the easy 
integration of a wide variety of device 
types, data sources and applications 
platforms in a secure environment.

The Internet of Things is important in the 
Smart City context because it provides 
access to new and better information in 
real time. This rapid access to new and 
better information impacts the quality 
of government services, enabling them 

to be provided more quickly, more 
efficiently, and in a more predictive and 
less reactive manner. This ultimately 
impacts every single person — citizen, 
visitor, business owner.

To be more specific, the IoT offers:

All IoT solutions require intelligent 
systems. Devices or things in the IoT are 
managed by these intelligent systems, 
defined as securely managed electronic 
systems that run a high-level operating 
system (HLOS) and autonomously 
connect to the Internet, execute 
native or cloud-based applications, 
and facilitate data analysis. Research 
indicates that traditional embedded 
systems are also being enhanced to 
function like intelligent systems in IoT 
solutions in some cases.

Access to better, faster information: 
Access to “better” information means 
access to more granular, automated 
information often provided in real time or 
near real time as opposed to waiting for 
an update manually. Parking sensors, for 
example, provide immediate information 
when a parking space is empty, instead 
of requiring people to drive around to 
find an empty spot. Public buses can 
alert a transportation management 
center of their location continuously, 
allowing managers to create improved 
routes and schedules, follow traffic 
patterns, and update digital signs or 
provide alerts via apps so citizens 
waiting for the buses know when they 
will arrive.

Rapid automation: Some information 
may already be collected by people, 
but because of resource constraints, 
it cannot be collected as often or as 
detailed as needed. For example, 
inspectors collect data on the 
structural integrity of bridges and 
other infrastructure, but there are 
rarely enough inspectors to regularly 
and thoroughly inspect all the bridges 
that need it. Sensors on bridges can 
provide information on the structural 
integrity of the bridge at regular 

Access to new information: 
Devices, whether intelligent devices 
with embedded analytics or “dumb” 
IP-enabled devices that merely 
transmit information, can provide 
departments with new information. 
Some of this information will be new 
by virtue of the type of device. For 
example, strategically placed acoustic 
sensors that pick up gunshots have 
shown that previous assumptions 
on the level of gun activity in certain 
neighbourhoods in the U.S. were 
wrong. Police departments operated 
on the assumption that when shots 
were fired, 80% of the time someone 
called 911. In fact, this percentage 
could be as low as 20% of the time, 
a fact that was revealed when these 
sensors were able to pick up actual 
gunshots, providing new information 
and insight.

intervals, alerting inspectors when there 
are potential problems that need to be 
addressed.

Often when buyers think of the IoT, they 
begin with the endpoints themselves 
— the vast types of sensors, wearable 
devices, and surveillance cameras. 
However, the IoT is a solution that 
covers the entire technology stack 
as well as the associated services to 
integrate, deploy, and support solutions 
and the security required at every 
level. Below, IDC has highlighted key 
platforms in the IoT architecture.

IDC’s current definition of the Internet of Things has 
evolved to underscore the requirement that the IoT 
system is defined precisely as an intelligent system 
or enhanced traditional embedded system that must 
have IP connectivity.

Three types of computing platforms are 
briefly highlighted below as emerging 
areas of IoT:

 “Cloud is not only yet another delivery 
model supporting existing storage 
workloads — it is an essential enabler 
for development and proliferation 
of a broad range of next-generation 
applications and services.”from 

Data Service Platform

Within the platform layer for Smart 
Cities, two types of platforms are 
included: device enablement and 
application enablement. Each type 
of platform offers functionality to 
support an endpoint; however, while 
they are not interchangeable, they are 
interdependent. Many platform providers 
deliver services across the layers 
offering comprehensive end-to-end 
solutions. 

Device enablement is a combination of 
services purchased from vendors and 
service providers for their municipal 
customers, such as device provisioning 
and enablement. At its most basic level, 
device enablement is about device 
management and providing software 
that ensures the flow of data to and 
from the end device. Key components 
include:

Long-Term Evolution-IoT (eLTE-IoT), of which 
Huawei offers its proprietary ‘eLTE-IoT’ line, 
enables high bandwidth, high availability and 
short latency connectivity for IoT devices.

Application enablement focuses on 
the horizontal integration of enterprise 
applications and specific vertical 
applications to fit the use case for a 
connected endpoint. It also focuses on 
the burgeoning area of analytics and the 
capability to build analytical tools for 
businesses to make real-time decisions 
about collected data. Key components 
of this platform solution include:

Computing Service Platform

Analytics software. This element 
uses the data collected by the 
connected endpoint to turn it into 
actionable insights that business 
decision makers can use to affect 
change in business processes.

Application software. This 
element uses software that either 
extrapolates information produced 
by the analytics software or serves 
as an input mechanism and is 
designed to deliver a specific 
functionality, either horizontal or 
industry specific, within the IoT 
solution.

IoT purpose-built platform. This 
element ensures the flow of data 
to/from the end device through the 
network, allowing the collection 
and analysis of connection-related 
information and the integration of 
enterprise applications and IoT-
specific applications.

Security software. This element is 
responsible for the security of the IoT 
solution and network. This can also 
be a preexisting security software 
solution.

Device Enablement  P lat forms

• Certification

• Diagnostics

• Enablement

• Provisioning

Cities have many areas of potential 
use cases, like remote monitoring 
or surveillance in public safety, or 
in transportation, environmental 
monitoring, or energy monitoring. The 
challenge is less about the potential 
uses of applications but finding the 
business model that can pay back the 
initial investment as well as support the 
application system maintenance.

Another challenge is to build analytics 
into applications so that business 
processes can be improved. With 
devices able to capture critical 
operational information, it is paramount 
for analytics to become a standard 
feature in these applications.

The data service platform takes the 
data from the communication hubs or 
controllers, sensors, RFID tags, or other 
such wired or wirelessly connected IoT 
devices and is capable of capturing 
massive amounts of multi-source data 
often in near or real-time.  This near real-
time processing requires highly efficient 
data processing, and includes:

• API support

• Vertically focused applications

• Analytics

• Shared, standard service: 
built for multitenancy, among 
or within enterprises

• Solution packaged: a 
“turnkey” offering, pre-
integrates required resources

• Self-service: provisioning and 
management, typically via a 
web portal and APIs

• Elastic resource scaling: 
dynamic, rapid, and fine-
grained

• Elastic, use-based pricing: 
supported by service 
metering

• Published service interface 
(API): web services, other 
common Internet APIs

 IDC defines cloud services more formally 
through a checklist of key attributes that 
an offering must manifest to end users 
of the service. To qualify as a “cloud 
service,” as defined by IDC, an offering 
must support all of the following six 
attributes:

Edge/fog computing is defined as 
computing performed near the edge 
of a WAN or near sensors, devices, or 
equipment (collectively referred to as 
“endpoint devices”) at the edge (as 
opposed the center of a cloud). This 
form of computing allows organizations 
to satisfy response speed and low-cost 
requirements that were impossible 
through direct communication between 
endpoint devices and servers gathered 
in a central location.

Edge/fog computing is similar in 
concept to cloud computing, and is 
in fact a supplemented and expanded 
version of that technology. Although 
edge/fog computing itself is not a new 
concept, it is again gaining a great deal 
of attention in the context of IoT.

Edge/fog computing is crucial for 
using ICT to link people and things 
distributed widely throughout society, 

as endpoint devices that generate raw 
data and clouds are simply not enough 
to accomplish this. Edge/fog computing 
is capable of providing high value to the 
real world by analyzing data at a more 
granular level close to the source of the 
data and feeding the results back in real 
time.

In addition to improving real-time 
response close to IoT endpoint devices, 
edge/fog computing will also likely 
develop into wide area decentralized 
cooperative platforms for IoT and data 
distribution business platforms by 
connecting with endpoint devices.

Public cloud services are shared 
among unrelated enterprises and/
or consumers, open to a largely 
unrestricted universe of potential 
users, and designed for a market, 
not a single enterprise.

Private cloud services are 
shared within a single enterprise 
or an extended enterprise, with 
restrictions on access and level of 
resource dedication, and defined/
controlled by the enterprise, 
beyond the control available in 
public cloud offerings.

Edge Comput ing

Demand for high-performance 
computing (HPC), also called 
supercomputing, has skyrocketed 
in recent years, given that it boasts 
spectacular ROI. According to a recent 
IDC study for the U.S. Department of 
Energy, HPC delivers $356 in return for 
every $1 invested. The global market 
for HPC servers, software, storage, and 
services in fact grew from $2 billion in 
1990 to $21.9 billion in 2012, and is 
forecasted by IDC to reach $30 billion 
by 2017. Once limited to government 
and university researchers, HPC today 
is used to help design products ranging 
from automobiles and aircraft to golf 
clubs, animated films, mutual funds, 
potato chips, and diapers — not to 
mention HPC’s crucial role in finding oil 
deposits and forecasting the weather. 
IDC estimates that HPC has helped 
PayPal save more than $700 million by 
enabling real-time detection of credit 
card fraud, an HPC application that is 
finding its way into national government 
programs in the United States and 
elsewhere. 

High Performance Computing

Smart & Connected Healthcare: 
The connected healthcare IT 
infrastructure is made possible 
because of intelligent devices 
(including smartphones and wireless 
medical devices) and pervasive 
broadband networks that provide 
always on connectivity, along with 
Big Data, analytics, and cloud 
computing. 

Smart education: Smart education 
uses integrated hardware, software, 
services and sensors to improve 
all aspects of providing quality 
education — from managing 
facilities, student care, and safety 
to interactive classrooms and digital 
curricula. 

Smart transportation: Intelligent 
transportation systems leverage 
IoT to monitor the movement of 
people and freight on transportation 
infrastructure such as surface 
roads, highways, intersections, 
public transportation (i.e., light-
rail, subways, buses), bridges, and 
tunnels.

Smart grid: The smart grid enables 
more efficient outage management 
and revenue-generating business 
processes while also allowing utilities 
to connect with end users and the 
premise-based assets that allow for 

Smart lighting: Connected LED 
lighting is IP- connected and provides 
remote monitoring, programmable, 
adaptable dimming and brightening, 
intelligent energy metering and billing 
and whose physical infrastructure is 
used for additional connected devices 
that are interoperable between 
devices and systems both to collect 
and transmit data to the community, 
utilities, the private sector, and 
multiple government departments.  
Connected LED generates hard 
benefits like energy and operational 
savings, and softer benefits like crime 
reduction due to greater visibility, 
and the reduction of light pollution. 
Additionally, the streetlight becomes 
a platform for additional Smart City 
services using the existing light pole 
infrastructure which is ideal for other 
sensors and devices given its ubiquity, 
elevation, and access to a power 
source; light post can function as a 
citizen services platform for things 
like directions, signage and alerts, 
charging, etc.

Municipal administration: Smart 
City administration aggregates and 
analyzes information within a Smart 
City ICT ecosystem and makes it 
accessible across all departments 
and agencies. This data serves as 
the foundation for new and improved 
internal business processes 
and decision making for a city’s 
infrastructure (facilities, pipe lines, 
water, waste). 

Together, the connecting, data service and compute 
platforms make it possible to deliver real benefits to 
residents, businesses and governments alike.

Common use cases for the IoT 
include:

(http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?container-
Id=244316&pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY)

improved management of electric 
usage, distributed generation, and 
customer experience. The smart 
grid consists of instrumented gas 
pipelines, electric transmission 
and distribution networks, smart 
metering and communications, and 
smart home energy management 
and demand response.

These attributes apply to all cloud 
services — in all public and private cloud 
service deployment models — although 
the specifics of how each attribute 
applies may vary slightly among these 
deployment models. At the highest level, 
the two types of deployment models for 
cloud services are public and private.

Intelligent Operation Center

IOCs are critical applications in day to 
day city operations. IOCs allow cities 
to integrate and coordinate disparate 
data sources in real-time or near real-
time, giving cities a comprehensive, 
integrated, operational and actionable 
picture of the city’s assets. Open 
data exchange, together with non-
proprietary, standards-based IT creates 
a collaborative ecosystem where data 
is shared seamlessly and solutions are 
interoperable. Integrated near-real-
time data visualization gives cities the 
understanding and insights necessary to 
manage operations optimally.

IOC solutions bring directional and 
actionable clarity to service delivery 
and operations. IOCs provide 
comprehensive, end-to-end support 
for Smart City businesses, acting 
as a central orchestrating element 
for numerous Smart City systems 
including: administrative systems 
(implementing business data exchange 
and coordination); industrial (integrating 
city needs with industrial planning), and; 
environmental (monitoring, forecasting 
and treatment of water, energy, air and 
soil). It bears noting that command and 

control centers are completely different 
entities than an IOC, with the latter 
functioning as data exchange layer for 
many different elements of a Smart City, 
including the safe city.

However, in times of crisis, IOCs are 
force multipliers for command and 
control situations – critical tools that 
allow public safety organizations to 
integrate a plethora of information 
sources, allowing tri-service 
organizations to leverage advanced 
analytics, GIS visualization software, 
sensor-driven data generated by the 
IoT and mobile-driven applications. 
GIS technologies should not be 
underemphasized in this regard; 
they pictorially make sense of the 
overwhelming flood of data with which 
organizations currently struggle.

Next generation ICT catalyzes the digital 
transformation of city administration, the 
daily lives of residence, the economic 
milieu, ultimately optimizing the 
efficiency and quality of government 
services. In the section which follows, 
we explore how some cities are 
leveraging the Intelligent Operating 
Center as a means to achieving these 
goals.

The Safe City 

The assurance of public safety is an 
historical founding driver of civil society, 
and, in the view of numerous notable 
political theorists, the essential reason 
individuals and societies agreed to 
create the institution of government. 
Safety is also arguably the primal 

or base motivation for humanity; 
psychologist Abraham Maslow calls 
out access to basic necessities like 
clean water, shelter, food, and safety as 
fundamental human needs which must 
be in place before individuals can pursue 
loftier goals like self-actualization. Today, 
moving beyond history and theory into 
very tangible practical realities, the Safe 
City is often an under-acknowledged 
prerequisite to realizing Smart Cities. 

Safe Cities deliver both social value 
– in terms of better overall quality of 
life – and economic value – in terms 
of industrial development, improved 
employment rates and revenue 
generation from sources such as 
increased tourism. While we cannot 
directly correlate the two factors, 
cities with higher unemployment rates 
tend to have higher crime, and cities 
with lower crime rates have lower 
unemployment rates. According to 
a US study from 2015, the top 25 
safest cities in the US have average 
unemployment rates of 5.2%, compared 
to a national average of 6.3%; in 
contrast, average unemployment in the 
US's top ten most dangerous cities is 
28.5% (http://247wallst.com/special-
report/2015/09/30/the-most-dangerous-
cities-in-america-5/4/). 

Similar correlations can be made 
between safety and the revenue 
generated by tourism. A 2004 study by 
Glensor and Peak stated, for example, 
that “the most important prerequisite 
for a successful tourism industry is 
a reputation for keeping crime under 
control and guaranteeing tourists’ 
safety.” (http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/
mime/open.pdf?Item=1306) Indeed 
the stakes are high here as the global 
tourism industry generates $7.6 trillion 
dollars a year.  

Safe Cities uses ICT to predict, prevent, 
and reduce crime; address new and 
emerging threats; improve emergency/
disaster planning and response; reduce 
the cost of operations; and allocate 
resources more effectively. Safe 
Cities work to create safe and livable 
communities using a variety of tools 
such as advanced analytics, social 
media, collaboration and information 
sharing tools, and mobile technologies 
to support emergency response 
services (fire, police, paramedic, search 
and rescue, coast guard, etc.), local 
law enforcement and policing, and 
the justice and corrections system 
including local courts, locally operated 
jails and prisons, probation, community 
corrections, and parole

In short, Smart Cities with strong 
safe city underpinnings are reliant on 
a suite of technology that includes 
video surveillance, emergent video 
communication, integrated incident 
command and control, big data, mobile, 
and secured public safety cloud.

Huawei’s Smart City solutions have been deployed in more than 60 
cities across 20 different countries, with 30 smart cities projects 
underway in China alone, where it is supporting the Chinese nation-
al government in its strategy to create a national standard for Smart 
Cities. Further to that, 100 Huawei’s Safe City solutions span 30 coun-
tries and serve more than 400 million people. Huawei’s Smart City 
solutions are founded on ubiquitous connectivity, information interop-
erability (both information sharing and integration), and inter-depart-
mental collaboration. 

HUAWEI: NEXT GENERATION Smart City SOLUTIONS Huawei has spent considerable time 
and effort building out specialized Smart 
City modules on a unified platform for 
multiple, integrated, interoperable uses 
that allow cities to address specific 
pain points related to a plethora of use 
cases such as traffic, energy, and public 
safety. Its Smart City enabling solutions 
are modular and focus on urban 
development, social development: and 
ICT Infrastructure.

 As shown in Figure 6, the Huawei 
platform integrates the connection 
service platform, the computing 
service platform and the data 
service platform, leveraging the 
IoT, integrating innumerable 
information sources, in an intelligent, 
collaborative manner. Combined, the 
platform provides next-generation 
ICT through which it, in conjunction 
with its partners, can build Smart 
City applications.

Huawei’s clients move through three 
waves of Smart City maturity. In the first, 
they concentrate on ICT infrastructure 
modernization. In the second, they 
focus on modernizing service delivery 
and service management; in the last 
they focus on internally and externally 
focused innovation. 

Huawei new ICT integrates leading 
technologies, resources, and 
ecosystems to build a high-tech nervous 
system for city administration. IOC is the 
most important part of the Smart City. 
IOC serves as the brain for the digital 
world, while IoT connects the digital and 
physical worlds to bring the efficiency of 
city operation to a new level. 

To realize the Smart City, three 
essential platforms need to be 
established:

Glocal Openlab

Part of Huawei’s open innovation 
strategy, Glocal Open Labs cultivate 
open innovation by providing cutting-
edge organizational and technical 
platforms that cater to local industry 
specialties. Stationed around the 
world adjacent to key industrial 
centers, Glocal Open Labs leverage 
an ecosystem of solutions, partner 
resources, subject matter and technical 
experts, and physical labs in which 
to explore and create solutions. The 
business innovation of Openlab drives 
innovation for client business, industry 
solutions, and ICT infrastructure. For 
example, the Singapore Open Lab is 
focused on Smart City, finance, and 
Internet of Things. It opened on August 
17 2016 and serves Asia Pacific, 
including Australia, Singapore, New 
Zealand, and many other countries.

Huawei calls this a “win-win 
ecosystem” which involves a Smart 
City ecosystem for more than 5,000 
partners. Huawei’s Smart City channel 
strategy is built on both a broad and 
deep collaborative partner ecosystem. 
This maximizes value for Huawei, its 
clients, and its channel partners as it 
delivers core service strengths from all 
involved parties. Combined, Huawei’s 
partner ecosystem includes more 
than 4,000 Tier 1 (Distributors and 
VARs), Tier 2 (Gold, Silver, Authorized) 
and Registered Partners who have 
accepted the Indirect Channel Partner 
Agreement and successfully registered 
as a Huawei partner. Partners benefit 
greatly from the arrangement as 
Huawei Enterprise Business Group 
(BG) offers its partners open API, 
access to global expertise and sand-
box type lab resources.

Huawei offers IoT solutions in many 
of the industries and sub-verticals 
pivotal to Smart Cities, including 

smart metering, building energy-
efficiency management, connected 
street lights, water heater monitoring, 
smart manufacturing and intelligent 
transportation solutions. Huawei’s IoT 
solutions are delivered by partnering 
with local service providers in EMEA, 
ASIA, Latin America and, increasingly, in 
North America. Many of its partnerships 
are geared to pressing social issues 
specific to a given city or nation. In 
China for example, bolstering fitness 
was one of the stated objectives of 
China’s 12th five-year plan. Huawei 
developed its IoT-powered Smart 
Gym solution to address China’s 
comparatively low fitness participation 
levels; for example, less than 20% 
of Chinese citizens who reported 
exercising at all did so in a gym. 
Additionally, those who reported that 
they didn’t exercise state that the 
lack of facilities was the main reason. 
Huawei’s Smart Gym solution connects 
all equipment to the network so that 
accurate fitness data, trainers are 
patched in via the cloud to provide 
on-site training and guidance; the IoT 
solution comes with smart reservation, 
entrance control, goods storage, 
and environment adjustment. Lastly, 
operations and maintenance data are 
collected and managed preventatively. 

Huawei Smart City solution 
enables clients and partners to 
build leading win-win ecosystems, 
laying the foundation for sustained 
development of smart society. 
Huawei has focused on improving 
ICT infrastructure, delivering high-
performance, agile, reliable, secure, 
and scalable infrastructure. At the 
same time, Huawei also works with 
partners to develop features and 
interfaces, collaborating with partners 
on various platforms to support 
customer business applications and 
rapidly respond to customer needs. 
One of the approaches to showcase 
Huawei’s good partnerships in action is 
establishing the OpenLab.

Data Service Platform: Acquire 
massive amounts of multi-source 
data, store the data, and process 
and analyze it for data sharing and 
improving operational efficiency

Connecting Service Platform: 
Collect and consolidate information 
from every corner of the city, 
transmit them to the different 
functional platforms and applications 
of smart cities, and manage the 
overall transmission network. For 
instance, when a new city district 
starts construction, IoT networks 
connecting construction sites, street 
lamps, trash bins, parking systems, 
water meters, and environmental 
monitoring sensors can be integrated 
to achieve real-time monitoring, 
warning systems, and management.

Computing Service Platform: Edge 
computing, Cloud storage, cloud 
computing, and high-performance 
computing

Huawei is laying a foundation for 
the future development of a smart 
society by building an ecosystem of 
partners and customers.

Kenya is an excellent example of the 
types of smart and safe city solutions, 
leveraging both the commend center 
and the IOT, being implemented by 
Huawei. As part of its national strategy 
to protect its people, promote tourism 
and encourage foreign economic 
investment, Kenya recently implemented 
a next generation commend center 
aimed primarily at protecting its two 
largest cities – Nairobi and Mombasa. 
Kenya has been the target of a number 
of recent terrorist attacks including the 
Mandera quarry and school bus attacks 
(64 deaths), the Westgate mall shootings 
(67 deaths, 175 injuries), and the Garissa 
University shootings (148 deaths, 79 
injuries). In addition, more than 30% 
of residents had suffered a robbery 
or carjacking, and the economy was 
suffering with a downturn in tourism and 
foreign investment. These events led 
the Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, 
to declare the implementation of the 
commend center as one of the country’s 
highest priorities to improve public 
safety..

Huawei, in partnership with Safaricom 
(Kenya’s largest mobile network 
operator) began working with the 
Kenyan government and police force to 
implement a next-generation commend 
center to manage this unrest. Huawei 
and Safaricom needed to surmount 
a number of challenges specific to 
Kenya: first, the Kenyan police had 

been historically under-provisioned 
in terms of ICT; second, the ratio of 
police officers to citizens was very low, 
1,150:1 as compared to the American 
recommendation of 450:1; and third, 
there were considerable bandwidth 
issues to address across the country. 
The partnership with Safaricom sought 
to accelerate the implementation of a 
national mobile broadband network 
upon which the national safety network 
could be implemented. To date, the 
commend center consists of the 
following solutions:

The solution provides:

A district of Shenzhen China, Longgang 
hosts a wide variety of high-tech, 
transportation and logistics, advanced 
manufacturing and financial firms. The 
city recently found itself struggling with 
triad of critical social and economic 
issues: digital transformation; social 
cohesion and governance, and 
economic development.

Seeking to build on its existing 
strengths, Longgang partnered with 
Huawei and its broad ecosystem of 
industry-leading solution providers to 
build an intelligent urban infrastructure, 
part of its Smart Longgang strategy.

For Longgang residents and municipal 
workers alike, the solution needed to 
be convenient, usable, and efficient in 
its delivery of next-generation public 
services. It also needed to provide city 
administration with smart, sophisticated 
tools that would help raise Longgang’s 
livability as well as digitally enabling a 
number of its key existing industries.

Smart Longgang Case Study

Panoramic surveillance:  Optical 
fiber transmission has been adopted 
for network access with different site 
models designed for different users 
to support national-level monitoring 
system.

Integrated direction: Video 
surveillance, video conferencing, 
and eLTE solutions enable better 
monitoring and dispatch as well as 
more efficient administration.

Intelligent analytics: a platform 
for video analytics for unified 
management of all video sources, 
allowing for on-site monitoring 
and mobile and digital evidence 
collection.

Measured success of the system has 
included:

A 19-fold increase in the 
number of effective 999 calls.  

A decrease in robbery and 
pilfering.

The proven ability to handle 
emergencies and enact 
advanced contingency plans in 
the face of terrorist attacks.

While it is always difficult to measure incidents that were 
prevented or did not occur as a result of this’ project, 
with Phase 1 of the commend center implementation 
complete, Kenya has tested the system during a number 
of prominent dignitary visits from the Pope and President 
Obama, during which there were no incidents. Kenya plan 
a future deployment of the commend center in 47 counties, 
touching18,000+ policemen, and 20,000+ auxiliary and 
special police. The country expects to see a decline in 
terrorist attacks, and an increase in public trust in its police 
and emergency systems as 999 calls are efficiently handled 
and police are better trained and monitored.

Longgang is an excellent example of 
a smart, safe city leveraging the IOC 
and IOT to deliver value to residents

Huawei and Partner Solutions

In conjunction with its partner 
ecosystem of leading vendors in the 
Smart Cities market, Huawei and 
the city of Longgang implemented a 
comprehensive, end-to-end platform 
solution leveraging cloud, virtualization, 
Big Data analytics, GIS and data 
visualization, and IoT. 

Solution platform must keep 
citizens at the center of city 
operations

Urban safety must be enhanced 
through next-generation 
technologies

Advanced analytical tools need 
to deliver real social value and 
increased livability

Leverage the IoT, Big Data 
analytics, cloud computing, 
mobile, social and cognitive to 
collectively catalyze existing 
industrial productivity

Take key insights from the 
Longgang pilot projects and 
iterate

Key challenges needed to be 
addressed by the solution:

Smart Longgang threads the device, to 
the network and its databases, leveraging 
visualization software, all deployed from a 
cloud delivery environment.

Safe, smart cities that are interested in developing an IOC 
and move forward with Smart City maturity should consid-
er the following best practices.

CONCLUSION: BEST PRACTICES MOVING FORWARD

Unified data aggregation and 
dissemination allows Longgang to 
engage in evidence-based service 
delivery 

Data visualization and spatial tools 
provide a richer, more realistic, 
depiction of issues and solutions

Keeping citizens at the center, in 
the channel of their choosing, has 
skyrocketed citizen satisfaction 
levels

Collaborative planning processes are 
unified and efficient

Hard and Soft Benefits

The Smart Longgang initiative centers 
on 11 pivotal projects all driving towards 
intelligent infrastructure, collaborative 
and efficient government service 
delivery, convenient resident utilization 
to create a more livable and productive 
urban environment for citizens and 
businesses alike.

The solution platform is premised 
on the following business needs:

Unified data exchange: 
Smart Longgang integrates, 
or interoperates, a number of 
databases critical to information 
sharing. By eliminating the traditional 
siloes involved in municipal 
service delivery, Longgang is able 
to optimize utilization of its data 
sets. The solution integrates data 
from more than 50 departments 
across three jurisdictional levels in 
Longgang

Incident Management: During 
an incident, the IOC provides first 
responders with collaborative, 
integrated communications 
channels, including integrated 
dispatch for public security / 
firefighting/ transportation/ medical 
treatment sectors and real-time voice 
and video information, so that tactics 
and instructions can be transmitted 
to the first line. First responders can 
also participate in real-time fusion 
consultations

Day-to-day data usability: As 
important, the IOC is also the daily 
operations management system 
for the city. In Longgang, the IOC 
functions like connective tissue, 

seamlessly integrating a scalable 
multitude of information and data 
sources. A number of specific apps 
have been created to leverage the 
data, including planning tools for new 
building development and industrial 
development, and public safety 
monitoring. The IOC is a platform that 
is rendered live by data visualization 
tools that reach out to residents and 
businesses.

Collectively, the Smart Longgang 
platform delivers an intelligent ecosystem 
of city management tools that are 
providing a safe city environment while at 
the same time leveraging the intelligent 
operating center for city administration, 
and smart sub-vertical solutions such as 
smart transportation, smart healthcare 
and smart citizen services.

Create a city-wide inclusive Smart City 
strategy. Creating an inclusive city-wide 
strategy serves to gather stakeholder 
input to prioritize the goals the city has as 
a Smart City, to focus the discussion on 
specific challenges that real stakeholders 
face, align departments around a common 
vision with internal and external buy-in, 
and differentiate each city in its approach 
to becoming smarter. By including external 
stakeholder input early on, the strategy 
gains local buy-in and legitimacy, and 
increases the likelihood for support of the 
related initiatives.

Take a platform approach to technology 
and realize there is regional variation 
in IOC implementation. Many cities are 
adopting citywide open platforms which 
allow them to leverage cloud-based 
technologies across the entire enterprise 
but that often are implemented as a federal 
model. Western cities are less likely to have 
large, multi-department operating centers, 
preferring to work with physically separate 
locations but with a shared data layer 
provided via cloud solutions.  Integrated 
data visualization at the enterprise level 
requires substantial buy-in from multiple 
stakeholders and departments. Once this 
is accomplished, however, the benefits of 
implementation will have far greater reach 
and impact for the city; risk will also be 
shared across departments. 

Look for quick wins. The development 
of Smart Cities is a long-term, complex 
endeavor, but the implementation of 
discrete Smart City projects, which fit into 
the long-term vision, does not have to be. 
Develop your strategic vision and then 
identify small, measurable, and public 
projects that will demonstrate success for 
example in smaller video analytics or body-
worn cameras deployments.

Governance. In IDC’s case study research, 
many public safety organizations have stressed 
that organizations beginning on multiagency 
data sharing arrangements should pay special 
attention to governance. Comparatively, 
technology is the easy part.

Multiagency focus from the onset. Tied 
closely to the economic challenges currently 
facing law enforcement, we recommend 
that organizations fundamentally change 
the operational ecosystem so that various 
units within a given organization, and among 
multiple agencies, pool resources and create 
centralized cloud repositories.

Data quality. Data quality and validation is 
critical to leverage insights across multiple 
agencies, and organizations typically 
underestimate the amount of effort required 
to harmonize and integrate information from 
multiple systems and agencies. Information 
exchange models such as NIEM will become 
invaluable in ensuring that data sharing can 
occur as fluidly as possible.

Seeking out scalability and integration 
ease. Irrespective of the cloud deployment 
model being implemented, cities must build 
or purchase a scalable architecture that can 
accommodate and manage all digital assets.

Mobile. Mobile is the next frontier for effective 
police service delivery and mobile-enabling 
core business solutions is key as police officers 
need to be able to both enter and receive real-
time data to enhance situational awareness.

Quantifying business outcomes. Oftentimes, 
municipal organizations do not make 
quantifying business outcomes a priority.  
However, IDC recommends that organizations 
define key KPIs prior to implementing an IOC 
to substantiate further business investments 
and to be able to effectively communicate 
success to citizens, tourists, and businesses.

A robust networking system needs city intelligence for full-process management: front-end sensing, data transmission, AI-

based decision-making, and actions.

• The digital platform and IOC 

constitute the AI “central 

nervous system,” supporting 

city operation monitoring and 

analysis, emergency linkage, and 

decision-making support.

• The IoT and city communications 

network form a “peripheral 

nervous system,” enabling all-

scenario automatic data 

collection and transmission and 

building digital twins for cities.

Beijing Builds Government Service Center to 
Better Serve Citizens

In 2015, the Beijing municipal government released a blueprint to create a government service center based on cloud computing 

technologies to streamline administration processes, build service-oriented governments, and improve service efficiency. The new 

service center was designed to interconnect with a wide assortment of service resources, enable unified service handling, approval, 

payment, and presentation, and eventually enhance government service quality.

Background

The legacy IT-based government service systems faced a number of challenges:

Information silos existed as a result of separate IT systems built by different agencies. This increased difficulties in information-  

sharing and cross-agency collaboration.

Computing and storage resources could not be shared across agencies. As a result, average resource usage was less than 16%.  

Different agencies used different kinds of security protection, increasing potential risks.  

Each agency needed at least two IT engineers to handle Operation and Maintenance (O&M). This resulted in low troubleshooting   

efficiency and quality and increased O&M costs.

Challenges



26Leading New ICT  Building a Better Smart City 

Huawei worked with its partners to provide a complete solution that included Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-

Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). The service center has built a unified data sharing and service exchange platform 

based on Huawei’s Distributed Cloud Data Center. With it, unified administrative approval and collaborative office systems have 

been developed.

A distributed architecture provides virtual Data Center (vDC) services for 44 government bureaus and 16 districts or counties   

throughout the city, enabling data sharing. 

Unified Data Sharing and Service Exchange Platform provides access to administrative and non-administrative approval services,   

enabling smooth information sharing and service interconnection across the city.

Unified Administrative Approval System enables unified service consultation, acceptance, handling, dispatching, supervision,   

and feedback.

Collaborative Office System supports daily office tasks. This system comprises an internal office portal and office platform.   

Solutions

The Beijing Government Service Center has accommodated 740 approval services (83 percent) from 44 agencies (89 percent). It   

centralizes service acceptance, handling, and certification, and streamlines administration processes. Citizens can process services 

at a single window without traveling to different agencies. 

Investment project approval processes have been reduced from 80 to 50, and the average approval time has been shortened   

from 300 to 109 workdays.

The distributed cloud data center improves IT resource usage from 16 percent to 55 percent, increases O&M efficiency by 70   

percent, and delivers 99.9999 percent data reliability.

improve its infrastructure, focusing on energy production, including renewable energy sources, as well as power transmission and 

distribution. However, the country’s power supply continues to face challenges as its economy develops.

Background

Severe Line Losses, Serious Electricity Theft:    In Nigeria, electricity theft often occurred due to the country’s out-of-date electric 

power infrastructure. The line loss rate was up to 40%.

Time-Consuming, Difficult Bill Collection:    Electricity bill collection was difficult. Only 60% of the electricity charges were 

collected, and the time needed to collect the bills was 3 months to 4 months.

Poor Work Efficiency:    There was no IT system that could be used to support service management or process user requirements. 

O&M staff had to read meters manually and, as a result, meter reading was inefficient and many times inaccurate.

Challenges

Henan Extends Quality Medical Resources to 
Faraway Patients

Henan Province ranks No. 1 among all of China’s provinces in agricultural revenues and population. However, with a population of 

100 million, the province faced uneven distribution of medical resources. 

According to the statistics, 80% of quality resources are owned by the top 30% of cities; less than 3% medical resources are available 

for the last 30% of cities, and almost no resources are available for suburbs and villages.

Background

The severe imbalance of medical resources creates inconveniences for patients as well as for large hospitals. 

Patients: Difficult Accessing to Hospital Treatment

Time-consuming: It takes about 3 days for people outside of Zhengzhou(capital city of Henan Province) to travel to and from   

FAHZU. To receive treatment, they need to queue in the hospital for at least 3 hours.

Costly: Nearly USD 200 is required for expenses like traveling, accommodations, food.   

Delayed treatment: Misdiagnosis made by an average hospital often results in missing the optimal treatment time for the patient.  

Hospital: Waste of Resources

FAHZU is the world’s largest hospital with over 10,000 beds in use.  

FAHZU is burdened with numerous patients experiencing mild symptoms and unable to focus on more serious illnesses, resulting   

in a waste of more than 1/3 of expert resources.

Challenges



30Leading New ICT  Building a Better Smart City 

FAHZU developed telemedicine services and formulated the following service development strategies:

Build a superior resource pool to connect more experts with leading technologies and enable continuous expansion of   

knowledge.

Extend high-quality medical resources to help average hospitals retain patients and provide treatment without having to travel   

long distances.

Launch a web portal for the existing medical resources to offer personalized medical care services.  

The project was constructed based on the “Province-City-County-Town-Village” five-level structure. The provincial level provides 

a Dual-center Provincial Telemedicine Cloud Platform, a convergent Videoconferencing Platform, and a Medical Big Data Analysis 

Platform. The Telemedicine Centers deploy all or some of the following facilities at each level: Teleconsultation Center, imaging 

teleconsultation room, ECG teleconsultation room, pathology teleconsultation room, tele-education room, remote surgery 

demonstration room, electronic library, Emergency Command and Treatment Center, and Integrated Command and Dispatch Center. 

Solutions

World’s largest telemedicine network: Currently, the service network covers hospitals in 18 cities and 130+ counties, and over   

1,000 primary care institutions. The solution connects to telemedicine systems of other provinces such as Sichuan as well as other 

countries such as the United States, Russia, and some African countries, to form the world’s largest telemedicine network. 

Easier access to medical treatment: Each year, approximately 120,000 patients are treated through tele-consultation, and 320   

tele-education sessions reaching 400,000 people are conducted.

Massive Cost Saving: saving medical and training costs by USD 160 Million each year.  

Mitigate the severe imbalance of medical resources due to reduced referral rate: general referral has been reduced by 21%.  

Enhanced patient satisfaction: the satisfaction rate has reached 97%.

Kenya Transforms Healthcare through Telemedicine 
with Hospital and Clinic Digitization

The public healthcare system was inefficient, poor quality, and lacked health experts in smaller cities like Lamu. The cost and time for 

citizens to travel to other facilities frequently delayed proper diagnosis or treatment. Few sustainable solutions have proven feasible 

despite the high priorities of the Health and ICT Ministries in Kenya (and similar countries).

Background

Poor Quality Healthcare
1 in 3 patients receive incorrect treatment.   

65% of clinics report out-of-stock for essential drugs.   

Lack of Health Specialists
Many patients live far away from advanced facilities. 17 more referral hospitals are required.  

86% of patients spend more on transportation to facilities than on healthcare.   

2 doctors for every 10,000 people.  

Inefficiencies
Facilities spend 2 days to 4 days per month on reporting.   

50% of health budget wasted by inefficiency and corruption.  

Challenges



32Leading New ICT  Building a Better Smart City 

A network combines health facilities with power, IT devices, IT software, and connectivity to create system-wide improvements in 

healthcare. The solution provides a high-tech facility and patient services which incorporates:

Huawei Matebooks and MicroClinic ZiDi™ software in health facilities improve the efficiency of reporting and billing, managing   

commodities, staffing, and patients.
